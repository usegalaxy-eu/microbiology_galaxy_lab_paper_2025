0,2025,Ecological Responses of Microbially Activated Water Flooding in Ultra-Low-Permeability Reservoirs: A Case Study of the B9 Reservoir in the Triassic Yanchang Formation,"The impact of anthropogenic disturbances during reservoir development on the ecological system—encompassing both environmental and microbial components—has long been overlooked. This study pioneers the investigation into the effects of microbially activated water flooding on both reservoir environments and indigenous microbial communities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the B9 Reservoir’s parameters before and after field testing, including the pH, redox potential, conductivity, chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, aqueous-phase cell concentration, aqueous-phase deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) concentration, oil-phase DNA concentration, and microbial population data. The results demonstrate that environmental parameters exhibit high sensitivity to microbially activated water flooding and effectively explain microbial blooms, while microbial blooms reciprocally alter the environmental conditions, forming a mutually influencing dynamic interplay. The 183-day microbially activated water flooding, while causing detectable impacts on the reservoir environment and microorganisms, did not pose a threat to its ecological stability and contributed to enhanced oil production. In contrast, the 60-month pilot test concluded 27 months earlier exhibited potential destabilization risks to the reservoir ecology. By simultaneously monitoring reservoir environments and microbial dynamics, this research not only addresses potential ecological risks associated with human-driven reservoir development but also provides actionable insights to optimize reservoir management strategies.",Microbiome,Community (taxonomy) profiling,,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

2,2024,Microbial education plays a crucial role in harnessing the beneficial properties of microbiota for infectious disease protection in Crassostrea gigas,"Background Recently, the frequency and severity of marine diseases have increased in association with global changes, and molluscs of economic interest are particularly concerned. Among them, the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) production faces challenges from several diseases such as the Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome (POMS) or vibriosis. Various strategies such as genetic selection or immune priming have been developed to fight some of these infectious diseases. The microbial education, which consist of exposing the host immune system to beneficial microorganisms during early life stages is a promising approach against diseases. This study explores the concept of microbial education using controlled and pathogen-free bacterial communities and assesses its protective effects against POMS and Vibrio aestuarianus infections, highlighting potential applications in oyster production. Results We demonstrate that it is possible to educate the oyster immune system by adding microorganisms during the larval stage. Adding culture based bacterial mixes to larvae protects only against the POMS disease while adding whole microbial communities from oyster donors protects against both POMS and vibriosis. The efficiency of the immune protection depends both on oyster origin and on the composition of the bacterial mixes used for exposure. No preferential protection was observed when the oysters were stimulated with their sympatric strains. We further show that the added bacteria were not maintained in the oyster microbiota after the exposure, but this bacterial addition induced long term changes in the microbiota composition and oyster immune gene expression. Conclusion Our study reveals successful immune system education of oysters by introducing beneficial micro-organisms during the larval stage. We improved the long-term resistance of oysters against critical diseases (POMS disease and Vibrio aestuarianus infections) highlighting the potential of microbial education in aquaculture.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR",,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
3,2023,Next-Generation Sequencing for the Detection of Microbial Agents in Avian Clinical Samples,"Simple Summary Significant progress in next-generation sequencing (NGS) is positioning this technology as a key tool to be utilized in clinical diagnosis of disease agents and/or for veterinary surveillance. Recent advances in direct sequencing of poultry and other avian samples for the detection of microbial agents are reviewed here. This review, although not comprehensive, highlights key developments in avian NGS-based technology for diagnostic uses during the last five years and discusses the future challenges for practical implementation, as well as potential applications in new areas related to poultry production. Abstract Direct-targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS), with its undoubtedly superior diagnostic capacity over real-time PCR (RT-PCR), and direct-non-targeted NGS (ntNGS), with its higher capacity to identify and characterize multiple agents, are both likely to become diagnostic methods of choice in the future. tNGS is a rapid and sensitive method for precise characterization of suspected agents. ntNGS, also known as agnostic diagnosis, does not require a hypothesis and has been used to identify unsuspected infections in clinical samples. Implemented in the form of multiplexed total DNA metagenomics or as total RNA sequencing, the approach produces comprehensive and actionable reports that allow semi-quantitative identification of most of the agents present in respiratory, cloacal, and tissue samples. The diagnostic benefits of the use of direct tNGS and ntNGS are high specificity, compatibility with different types of clinical samples (fresh, frozen, FTA cards, and paraffin-embedded), production of nearly complete infection profiles (viruses, bacteria, fungus, and parasites), production of “semi-quantitative” information, direct agent genotyping, and infectious agent mutational information. The achievements of NGS in terms of diagnosing poultry problems are described here, along with future applications. Multiplexing, development of standard operating procedures, robotics, sequencing kits, automated bioinformatics, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) are disciplines converging toward the use of this technology for active surveillance in poultry farms. Other advances in human and veterinary NGS sequencing are likely to be adaptable to avian species in the future.","Bacteria, Virus",,"(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Health & Disease
4,2023,Population structure and genetic diversity of Streptococcus suis isolates obtained from the United States,"Diseases caused by the zoonotic pathogen Streptococcus suis are an extensive economic problem as well as an animal welfare concern for the global swine industry. Previous studies have evaluated the genomic diversity and population structure of S. suis isolates, however, the majority of these studies utilized isolates obtained from countries other than the U.S. This study applied whole genome sequencing and cgMLST-based typing to evaluate the population structure and genetic relatedness among S. suis isolates obtained within the U.S. The established high-resolution phylogenomic framework revealed extensive genomic variation and diversity among the sampled S. suis isolates, with isolates from the U.S. and from countries outside the U.S. found interspersed in the phylogeny. S. suis isolates obtained within the U.S. did not cluster by state or geographic location, however, isolates with similar serotypes, both obtained from within and outside the U.S., generally clustered together. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) values determined for the S. suis genomes were extensively broad, approaching the recommended species demarcation value, and correlated with the phylogenetic group distribution of the cgMLST-based tree. Numerous antimicrobial resistance (AMR) elements were identified among both U.S. and non-U.S. isolates with ble, tetO, and ermB genes identified as the most prevalent. The epf, mrp, and sly genes, historically used as markers for virulence potential, were also observed in the genomes of isolates that grouped together forming a subclade of clonal complex 1 (CC1) isolates. Collectively, the data in this report provides critical information needed to address potential biosurveillance needs and insights into the genetic diversity and population structure of S. suis isolates obtained within the U.S.",Pathogen,"Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR, (M)LST",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
5,2023,Comparative Microbiome Analysis of Three Epidemiologically Important Tick Species in Latvia,"(1) Background: Amplicon-based 16S rRNA profiling is widely used to study whole communities of prokaryotes in many niches. Here, we comparatively examined the microbial composition of three tick species, Ixodes ricinus, Ixodes persulcatus and Dermacentor reticulatus, which were field-collected in Latvia. (2) Methods: Tick DNA samples were used for microbiome analysis targeting bacterial 16S rDNA using next-generation sequencing (NGS). (3) Results: The results showed significant differences in microbial species diversity and composition by tick species and life stage. A close similarity between microbiomes of I. ricinus and I. persulcatus ticks was observed, while the D. reticulatus microbiome composition appeared to be more distinct. Significant differences in alpha and beta microbial diversity were observed between Ixodes tick life stages and sexes, with lower taxa richness indexes obtained for female ticks. The Francisella genus was closely associated with D. reticulatus ticks, while endosymbionts Candidatus Midichlorii and Candidatus Lariskella were associated with I. ricinus and I. persulcatus females, respectively. In I. ricinus females, the endosymbiont load negatively correlated with the presence of the Rickettsia genus. (4) Conclusions: The results of this study revealed important associations between ticks and their microbial community and highlighted the microbiome features of three tick species in Latvia.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Comparative analysis",Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

7,2023,Effect of Anthropogenic Disturbances on the Microbial Relationship during Bioremediation of Heavy Metal-Contaminated Sediment,"Soil, sediment, and waters contaminated with heavy metals pose a serious threat to ecosystem function and human health, and microorganisms are an effective way to address this problem. In this work, sediments containing heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Zn, Mn, Cd, As) were treated differently (sterilized and unsterilized) and bio-enhanced leaching experiments were carried out with the addition of exogenous iron-oxidizing bacteria A. ferrooxidans and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria A. thiooxidans. The leaching of As, Cd, Cu, and Zn was higher in the unsterilized sediment at the beginning 10 days, while heavy metals leached more optimally in the later sterilized sediment. The leaching of Cd from sterilized sediments was favored by A. ferrooxidans compared to A. thiooxidans. Meanwhile, the microbial community structure was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, which revealed that 53.4% of the bacteria were Proteobacteria, 26.22% were Bacteroidetes, 5.04% were Firmicutes, 4.67% were Chlamydomonas, and 4.08% were Acidobacteria. DCA analysis indicated that microorganisms abundance (diversity and Chao values) increased with time. Furthermore, network analysis showed that complex networks of interactions existed in the sediments. After adapting to the acidic environmental conditions, the growth of some locally dominant bacteria increased the microbial interactions, allowing more bacteria to participate in the network, making their connections stronger. This evidence points to a disruption in the microbial community structure and its diversity following artificial disturbance, which then develops again over time. These results could contribute to the understanding of the evolution of microbial communities in the ecosystem during the remediation of anthropogenically disturbed heavy metals.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome",Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
8,2023,Effect of deposit chemistry on microbial community structure and activity: Implications for under-deposit microbial corrosion,"Introduction The deposition of solid particles carried by production fluids from oil and gas companies in horizontal surfaces of different assets has shown to cause severe localised corrosion. Sand, one of the most common deposits in the energy sector pipelines, is frequently mixed with crude, oil, asphaltenes, corrosion inhibitors, and other organic compounds. For this reason, they might favour the metabolic activity of native microbial communities. This study aimed to determine the impact of sand-deposit chemical composition on the microbial community structure and functional attributes of a multispecies consortium recovered from an oilfield and the resulting risk of under-deposit microbial corrosion of carbon steel. Methods Sand deposits recovered from an oil pipeline were used in their raw form and compared against the same deposits exposed to heat treatment to remove organic compounds. A four-week immersion test in a bioreactor filled with synthetic produced water and a two-centimeter layer of sand was set up to assess corrosion and microbial community changes. Results The raw untreated deposit from the field containing hydrocarbons and treatment chemicals resulted in a more diverse microbial community than its treated counterpart. Moreover, biofilms developed in the raw sand deposit exhibited higher metabolic rates, with functional profile analysis indicating a predominance of genes associated with xenobiotics degradation. Uniform and localized corrosion were more severe in the raw sand deposit compared to the treated sand. Discussion The complex chemical composition of the untreated sand might have represented an additional source of energy and nutrients to the microbial consortium, favoring the development of different microbial genera and species. The higher corrosion rate obtained under the untreated sand suggests that MIC occurred due to syntrophic relationships between sulphate reducers or thiosulphate reducers and fermenters identified in the consortium.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis",,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
9,2022,"Geographical distance, host evolutionary history and diet drive gut microbiome diversity of fish across the Yellow River","Fish represent a large part of the taxonomic diversity of vertebrates and are of high commercial value. However, the factors influencing the gut microbiota composition of freshwater fish over large spatial scales remain unclear. Therefore, this study explored gut microbiome diversity in 24 fish species from the Yellow River, which spans over 1500 km across China. The results showed that geographical distance, host phylogeny and diet significantly influenced gut microbial community diversity, whereas sex, body length and body weight had minimal influence. Geographical distance was the primary factor shaping gut microbiota, and dissimilarity in microbial community structure increased with an increase in geographical distance, which was mainly driven by dispersal limitation. The microbial communities were more homogeneous at higher host taxonomic resolutions due to the dominant role of homogeneous selection in community convergence. Phylosymbiosis was observed across all host species, with a stronger pattern in Cypriniformes, which harbour host‐specific microbial taxa. Host diet explained little variation in gut microbiome diversity, although it was significant for all diversity metrics tested. These findings collectively suggest that the geographical and host‐based patterns of fish gut microbiota tend to be shaped by different ecological forces across the Yellow River. The present work provides a robust assessment of multiple factors driving fish gut microbial community assembly and offers insight into the mechanisms underlying shifts in fish gut microbiota in rivers across large spatial scales.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, MAGs",,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
10,2022,iNAP: An integrated network analysis pipeline for microbiome studies,"Abstract Integrated network analysis pipeline (iNAP) is an online analysis pipeline for generating and analyzing comprehensive ecological networks in microbiome studies. It is implemented in two sections, that is, network construction and network analysis, and integrates many open‐access tools. Network construction contains multiple feasible alternatives, including correlation‐based approaches (Pearson's correlation and Spearman's rank correlation along with random matrix theory, and sparse correlations for compositional data) and conditional dependence‐based methods (extended local similarity analysis and sparse inverse covariance estimation for ecological association inference), while network analysis provides topological structures at different levels and the potential effects of environmental factors on network structures. Considering the full workflow, from microbiome data set to network result, iNAP contains the molecular ecological network analysis pipeline and interdomain ecological network analysis pipeline (IDENAP), which correspond to the intradomain and interdomain associations of microbial species at multiple taxonomic levels. Here, we describe the detailed workflow by taking IDENAP as an example and show the comprehensive steps to assist researchers to conduct the relevant analyses using their own data sets. Afterwards, some auxiliary tools facilitating the pipeline are introduced to effectively aid in the switch from local analysis to online operations. Therefore, iNAP, as an easy‐to‐use platform that provides multiple network‐associated tools and approaches, can enable researchers to better understand the organization of microbial communities. iNAP is available at http://mem.rcees.ac.cn:8081 with free registration.",Microbiome,Community (taxonomy) profiling,,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
11,2022,Effects of Turning Frequency on Ammonia Emission during the Composting of Chicken Manure and Soybean Straw,"Here, we investigated the impact of different turning frequency (TF) on dynamic changes of N fractions, NH3 emission and bacterial/archaeal community during chicken manure composting. Compared to higher TF (i.e., turning every 1 or 3 days in CMS1 or CMS3 treatments, respectively), lower TF (i.e., turning every 5 or 7 days in CMS5 or CMS7 treatments, respectively) decreased NH3 emission by 11.42–18.95%. Compared with CMS1, CMS3 and CMS7 treatments, the total nitrogen loss of CMS5 decreased by 38.03%, 17.06% and 24.76%, respectively. Ammonia oxidizing bacterial/archaeal (AOB/AOA) communities analysis revealed that the relative abundance of Nitrosospira and Nitrososphaera was higher in lower TF treatment during the thermophilic and cooling stages, which could contribute to the reduction of NH3 emission. Thus, different TF had a great influence on NH3 emission and microbial community during composting. It is practically feasible to increase the abundance of AOB/AOA through adjusting TF and reduce NH3 emission the loss of nitrogen during chicken manure composting.","Bacteria, Archaea, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
12,2021,Impact of Dietary Isoflavone Supplementation on the Fecal Microbiota and Its Metabolites in Postmenopausal Women,"Isoflavones are metabolized by components of the gut microbiota and can also modulate their composition and/or activity. This study aimed to analyze the modifications of the fecal microbial populations and their metabolites in menopausal women under dietary treatment with soy isoflavones for one month. Based on the level of urinary equol, the women had been stratified previously as equol-producers (n = 3) or as equol non-producers (n = 5). The composition of the fecal microbiota was assessed by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons and the changes in fatty acid excretion in feces were analyzed by gas chromatography. A greater proportion of sequence reads of the genus Slackia was detected after isoflavone supplementation. Sequences of members of the family Lachnospiraceae and the genus Pseudoflavonifractor were significantly increased in samples from equol-producing women. Multivariable analysis showed that, after isoflavone treatment, the fecal microbial communities of equol producers were more like each other. Isoflavone supplementation increased the production of caproic acid, suggesting differential microbial activity, leading to a high fecal excretion of this compound. However, differences between equol producers and non-producers were not scored. These results may contribute to characterizing the modulating effect of isoflavones on the gut microbiota, which could lead to unravelling of their beneficial health effects.",Microbiome,Community (taxonomy) profiling,"Metabarcoding, Metabolomics",Health & Disease
13,2021,The gut microbiome is associated with cocaine behavior and predicts addiction vulnerability in adult male rats,"The gut-brain axis is a bi-directional communication system through which microbial communities in the gut interact with the nervous system, perhaps influencing neuropsychiatric disorders such as drug abuse. This study used behavioral data and biological samples from the Cocaine Biobank to test the hypothesis that the gut microbiota can predict and reflect susceptibility to cocaine reinforcement. Adult male heterogenous rats were catheterized and allowed to self-administer cocaine in short-access sessions (2 hr/day, 10 days, 0.5 mg/kg per intravenous infusion), followed by progressive ratio (PR) tests, long-access sessions (6 hr/day, 14 days), and alternating blocks of PR, long-access, and footshock testing. Fecal samples were collected at three time points and bacterial 16s rRNA genes were sequenced to profile the microbiota. As expected, cocaine-related behavior varied among subjects, such that a quartile split identified low and high responders on each measure, as well as an overall addiction index. Although beta diversity in the microbiota at baseline and after short access did not predict membership in high or low addiction quartiles, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) identified taxa that were more robustly represented in low or high responders. Beta diversity after long access was different among quartiles, as were several specific taxa. Investigation of baseline differences revealed that high relative abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila predicted future low response rates, whereas Ruminococcaceae predicted high response. This study is the first to report that microbiota variability reflects levels of cocaine intake and that microbial profiles might facilitate diagnosis and identify risk factors predictive of drug vulnerability. Significance Statement Microbial organisms inhabiting the gut of animals appear to influence organismal function through various signaling pathways, ultimately affecting behavior and disease vulnerability. This experiment investigates links between gut bacteria and vulnerability to addiction-related behaviors in adult male rats. Not only did gut bacterial profiles change as a result of cocaine intake but also gut bacterial profiles before any exposure to cocaine predicted which animals would be high or low addiction-prone individuals. These results suggest that microbial profiles might facilitate diagnosis and identify risk factors predictive of drug addiction.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis",Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
14,2021,Submucosal microbiome of peri‐implant sites: A cross‐sectional study,"Abstract Aim To study the peri‐implant submucosal microbiome in relation to implant disease status, dentition status, smoking habit, gender, implant location, implant system, time of functional loading, probing pocket depth (PPD), and presence of bleeding on probing. Materials and Methods Biofilm samples were collected from the deepest peri‐implant site of 41 patients with paper points, and analysed using 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. Results We observed differences in microbial profiles by PPD, implant disease status, and dentition status. Microbiota in deep pockets included higher proportions of the genera Fusobacterium, Prevotella, and Anaeroglobus compared with shallow pockets that harboured more Rothia, Neisseria, Haemophilus, and Streptococcus. Peri‐implantitis (PI) sites were dominated by Fusobacterium and Treponema compared with healthy implants and peri‐implant mucositis, which were mostly colonized by Rothia and Streptococcus. Partially edentulous (PE) individuals presented more Fusobacterium, Prevotella, and Rothia, whereas fully edentulous individuals presented more Veillonella and Streptococcus. Conclusions PPD, implant disease status, and dentition status may affect the submucosal ecology leading to variation in composition of the microbiome. Deep pockets, PI, and PE individuals were dominated by Gram‐negative anaerobic taxa.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis",Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
15,2021,Host habitat is the major determinant of the gut microbiome of fish,"Our understanding of the gut microbiota of animals is largely based on studies of mammals. To better understand the evolutionary basis of symbiotic relationships between animal hosts and indigenous microbes, it is necessary to investigate the gut microbiota of non-mammalian vertebrate species. In particular, fish have the highest species diversity among groups of vertebrates, with approximately 33,000 species. In this study, we comprehensively characterized gut bacterial communities in fish. We analyzed 227 individual fish representing 14 orders, 42 families, 79 genera, and 85 species. The fish gut microbiota was dominated by Proteobacteria (51.7%) and Firmicutes (13.5%), different from the dominant taxa reported in terrestrial vertebrates (Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes). The gut microbial community in fish was more strongly shaped by host habitat than by host taxonomy or trophic level. Using a machine learning approach trained on the microbial community composition or predicted functional profiles, we found that the host habitat exhibited the highest classification accuracy. Principal coordinate analysis revealed that the gut bacterial community of fish differs significantly from those of other vertebrate classes (reptiles, birds, and mammals). Collectively, these data provide a reference for future studies of the gut microbiome of aquatic animals as well as insights into the relationship between fish and their gut bacteria, including the key role of host habitat and the distinct compositions in comparison with those of mammals, reptiles, and birds. 2jWna3AEmgLMLS436bvUku Video Abstract Video Abstract","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis",,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
16,2021,"Mineralosphere Microbiome Leading to Changed Geochemical Properties of Sedimentary Rocks from Aiqigou Mud Volcano, Northwest China","The properties of rocks can be greatly affected by seepage hydrocarbons in petroleum-related mud volcanoes. Among them, the color of sedimentary rocks can reflect the changes of sedimentary environment and weathering history. However, little is known about the microbial communities and their biogeochemical significance in these environments. In this study, contrasting rock samples were collected from the Aiqigou mud volcano on the southern margin of the Junggar Basin in Northwest China as guided by rock colors indicative of redox conditions. The physicochemical properties and mineral composition are similar under the same redox conditions. For example, the content of chlorite, muscovite, quartz, and total carbon were higher, and the total iron was lower under reduced conditions compared with oxidized environments. High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons revealed that different functional microorganisms may exist under different redox conditions; microbes in oxidized conditions have higher diversity. Statistical analysis and incubation experiments indicated that the microbial community structure is closely related to the content of iron which may be an important factor for color stratification of continental sedimentary rocks in the Aiqigou mud volcano. The interactions between organics and iron-bearing minerals mediated by microorganisms have also been hypothesized.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome",Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
17,2021,The Postmedieval Latvian Oral Microbiome in the Context of Modern Dental Calculus and Modern Dental Plaque Microbial Profiles,"Recent advantages in paleomicrobiology have provided an opportunity to investigate the composition of ancient microbial ecologies. Here, using metagenome analysis, we investigated the microbial profiles of historic dental calculus retrieved from archaeological human remains from postmedieval Latvia dated 16–17th century AD and examined the associations of oral taxa and microbial diversity with specific characteristics. We evaluated the preservation of human oral microbiome patterns in historic samples and compared the microbial composition of historic dental calculus, modern human dental plaque, modern human dental calculus samples and burial soil microbiota. Overall, the results showed that the majority of microbial DNA in historic dental calculus originated from the oral microbiome with little impact of the burial environment. Good preservation of ancient DNA in historical dental calculus samples has provided reliable insight into the composition of the oral microbiome of postmedieval Latvian individuals. The relative stability of the classifiable oral microbiome composition was observed. Significant differences between the microbiome profiles of dental calculus and dental plaque samples were identified, suggesting microbial adaptation to a specific human body environment.","Archaea, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,"(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
18,2021,Analysis of sex differences in dietary copper-fructose interaction-induced alterations of gut microbial activity in relation to hepatic steatosis,"Background Inadequate copper intake and increased fructose consumption represent two important nutritional problems in the USA. Dietary copper-fructose interactions alter gut microbial activity and contribute to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this study is to determine whether dietary copper-fructose interactions alter gut microbial activity in a sex-differential manner and whether sex differences in gut microbial activity are associated with sex differences in hepatic steatosis. Methods Male and female weanling Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were fed ad libitum with an AIN-93G purified rodent diet with defined copper content for 8 weeks. The copper content is 6 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg in adequate copper diet (CuA) and marginal copper diet (CuM), respectively. Animals had free access to either deionized water or deionized water containing 10% fructose (F) (w/v) as the only drink during the experiment. Body weight, calorie intake, plasma alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and liver histology as well as liver triglyceride were evaluated. Fecal microbial contents were analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) sequencing. Fecal and cecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results Male and female rats exhibit similar trends of changes in the body weight gain and calorie intake in response to dietary copper and fructose, with a generally higher level in male rats. Several female rats in the CuAF group developed mild steatosis, while no obvious steatosis was observed in male rats fed with CuAF or CuMF diets. Fecal 16S rRNA sequencing analysis revealed distinct alterations of the gut microbiome in male and female rats. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) identified sex-specific abundant taxa in different groups. Further, total SCFAs, as well as, butyrate were decreased in a more pronounced manner in female CuMF rats than in male rats. Of note, the decreased SCFAs are concomitant with the reduced SCFA producers, but not correlated to hepatic steatosis. Conclusions Our data demonstrated sex differences in the alterations of gut microbial abundance, activities, and hepatic steatosis in response to dietary copper-fructose interaction in rats. The correlation between sex differences in metabolic phenotypes and alterations of gut microbial activities remains elusive.",Microbiome,Interactome,"Metabarcoding, (Meta)proteomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
19,2021,metaGEM: reconstruction of genome scale metabolic models directly from metagenomes,"Advances in genome-resolved metagenomic analysis of complex microbial communities have revealed a large degree of interspecies and intraspecies genetic diversity through the reconstruction of metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs). Yet, metabolic modeling efforts still tend to rely on reference genomes as the starting point for reconstruction and simulation of genome scale metabolic models (GEMs), neglecting the immense intra- and inter-species diversity present in microbial communities. Here we present metaGEM (https://github.com/franciscozorrilla/metaGEM), an end-to-end highly scalable pipeline enabling metabolic modeling of multi-species communities directly from metagenomic samples. The pipeline automates all steps from the extraction of context-specific prokaryotic GEMs from metagenome assembled genomes to community level flux balance simulations. To demonstrate the capabilities of the metaGEM pipeline, we analyzed 483 samples spanning lab culture, human gut, plant associated, soil, and ocean metagenomes, to reconstruct over 14 000 prokaryotic GEMs. We show that GEMs reconstructed from metagenomes have fully represented metabolism comparable to the GEMs reconstructed from reference genomes. We further demonstrate that metagenomic GEMs capture intraspecies metabolic diversity by identifying the differences between pathogenicity levels of type 2 diabetes at the level of gut bacterial metabolic exchanges. Overall, our pipeline enables simulation-ready metabolic model reconstruction directly from individual metagenomes, provides a resource of all reconstructed metabolic models, and showcases community-level modeling of microbiomes associated with disease conditions allowing generation of mechanistic hypotheses.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, MAGs","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
20,2020,Differential Gut Microbiota and Fecal Metabolites Related With the Clinical Subtypes of Myasthenia Gravis,"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a devastating acquired autoimmune disease. Previous studies have observed that disturbances of gut microbiome may attribute to the development of MG through fecal metabolomic signatures in humans. However, whether there were differential gut microbial and fecal metabolomic phenotypes in different subtypes of MG remains unclear. Here, our objective was to explore whether the microbial and metabolic signatures of ocular (OMG) and generalized myasthenia gravis (GMG) were different, and further identify the shared and distinct markers for patients with OMG and GMG. In this study, 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) were performed to capture the microbial and metabolic signatures of OMG and GMG, respectively. Random forest (RF) classifiers was used to identify the discriminative markers for OMG and GMG. Compared with healthy control (HC) group, GMG group, but not OMG group, showed a significant decrease in α-phylogenetic diversity. Both OMG and GMG groups, however, displayed significant gut microbial and metabolic disorders. Totally, we identified 20 OTUs and 9 metabolites specific to OMG group, and 23 OTUs and 7 metabolites specific to GMG group. Moreover, combinatorial biomarkers containing 15 discriminative OTUs and 2 differential metabolites were capable of discriminating OMG and GMG from each other, as well as from HCs, with AUC values ranging from 0.934 to 0.990. In conclusion, different subtypes of MG harbored differential gut microbiota, which generated discriminative fecal metabolism.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, Gene identification / Biomarker","Metabarcoding, (Meta)proteomics, Metabolomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

22,2020,Actinobacteria from Antarctica as a source for anticancer discovery,"Although many advances have been achieved to treat aggressive tumours, cancer remains a leading cause of death and a public health problem worldwide. Among the main approaches for the discovery of new bioactive agents, the prospect of microbial secondary metabolites represents an effective source for the development of drug leads. In this study, we investigated the actinobacterial diversity associated with an endemic Antarctic species, Deschampsia antarctica, by integrated culture-dependent and culture-independent methods and acknowledged this niche as a reservoir of bioactive strains for the production of antitumour compounds. The 16S rRNA-based analysis showed the predominance of the Actinomycetales order, a well-known group of bioactive metabolite producers belonging to the Actinobacteria phylum. Cultivation techniques were applied, and 72 psychrotolerant Actinobacteria strains belonging to the genera Actinoplanes, Arthrobacter, Kribbella, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Pilimelia, Pseudarthrobacter, Rhodococcus, Streptacidiphilus, Streptomyces and Tsukamurella were identified. The secondary metabolites were screened, and 17 isolates were identified as promising antitumour compound producers. However, the bio-guided assay showed a pronounced antiproliferative activity for the crude extracts of Streptomyces sp. CMAA 1527 and Streptomyces sp. CMAA 1653. The TGI and LC50 values revealed the potential of these natural products to control the proliferation of breast (MCF-7), glioblastoma (U251), lung/non-small (NCI-H460) and kidney (786-0) human cancer cell lines. Cinerubin B and actinomycin V were the predominant compounds identified in Streptomyces sp. CMAA 1527 and Streptomyces sp. CMAA 1653, respectively. Our results suggest that the rhizosphere of D. antarctica represents a prominent reservoir of bioactive actinobacteria strains and reveals it as an important environment for potential antitumour agents.",Bacteria,"Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling","Metabarcoding, Metabolomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

Methods: Male and female weanling Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were fed ad libitum with an AIN-93G purified rodent diet with defined copper content for 8 weeks. The copper content is 6mg/kg and 1.5mg/kg in adequate copper diet (CuA) and marginal copper diet (CuM), respectively. Animals had free access to either deionized water or deionized water containing 10% fructose (F) (w/v) as the only drink during the experiment. Body weight, calorie intake, plasma ALT, AST and liver histology were evaluated. Fecal microbial contents were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Fecal and cecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).Results: Male and female rats exhibit similar trends of changes in the body weight, body weight gain and calorie intake in response to dietary copper and fructose, with a generally higher level in male rats. Several female rats in CuAF group developed mild steatosis, while no obvious steatosis was observed in male rats fed with CuAF or CuMF. Fecal 16S rRNA sequencing analysis revealed distinct alterations of the gut microbiome in male and female rats. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) identified sex-specific abundant taxa in different groups. Further, total SCFAs, as well as, butyrate were decreased in a more pronounced manner in female CuMF rats than in male rats. Of note, the decreased SCFAs are concomitant with the reduced SCFA producers, but not correlated to hepatic steatosis. Conclusions: Our data demonstrated sex differences in the alterations of gut microbial activities and hepatic steatosis in response to dietary copper-fructose interaction in rats. Tissue-specific responses to dietary copper and fructose likely contribute to the sex differences in gut microbial activity and metabolic phenotype.",Microbiome,Interactome,"Metabarcoding, (Meta)proteomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
24,2020,SQMtools: automated processing and visual analysis of ’omics data with R and anvi’o,"The dramatic decrease in sequencing costs over the last decade has boosted the adoption of high-throughput sequencing applications as a standard tool for the analysis of environmental microbial communities. Nowadays even small research groups can easily obtain raw sequencing data. After that, however, non-specialists are faced with the double challenge of choosing among an ever-increasing array of analysis methodologies, and navigating the vast amounts of results returned by these approaches. Here we present a workflow that relies on the SqueezeMeta software for the automated processing of raw reads into annotated contigs and reconstructed genomes (bins). A set of custom scripts seamlessly integrates the output into the anvi’o analysis platform, allowing filtering and visual exploration of the results. Furthermore, we provide a software package with utility functions to expose the SqueezeMeta results to the R analysis environment. Altogether, our workflow allows non-expert users to go from raw sequencing reads to custom plots with only a few powerful, flexible and well-documented commands.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis",(Meta)genomics,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
25,2020,Integrative analysis of gut microbiome and metabolites revealed novel mechanisms of intestinal Salmonella carriage in chicken,"Intestinal carriage of Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) in the chicken host serves as a reservoir for transmission of Salmonella to humans through the consumption of poultry products. The aim of the current study was to examine the three-way interaction that occurred between host metabolites, resident gut microbiota and Salmonella following inoculation of SE in two-week-old layer chicks. Our results revealed an overall alteration in gut microbiome and metabolites in association with SE infection. Enriched colonization by different microbial members throughout the course of experimental infection highlighted significant fluctuation in the intestinal microbial community in response to Salmonella infection. As changes in community membership occurred, there was also subsequent impact on differential regulation of interlinked predicted functional activities within the intestinal environment dictated by Salmonella-commensal interaction. Alteration in the overall microbial community following infection also has a ripple effect on the host regulation of cecum-associated metabolic networks. The findings showed that there was differential regulation in many of the metabolites in association with SE colonization in chickens. Perturbation in metabolic pathways related to arginine and proline metabolism as well as TCA cycle was most prominently detected. Taken together, the present findings provided a starting point in understanding the effect of intestinal Salmonella carriage on the microbiome and metabolome of developing young layer chicks.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome",Metabolomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

27,2020,Assessment of peritoneal microbial features and tumor marker levels as potential diagnostic tools for ovarian cancer,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (OC) is the most deadly cancer of the female reproductive system. To date, there is no effective screening method for early detection of OC and current diagnostic armamentarium may include sonographic grading of the tumor and analyzing serum levels of tumor markers, Cancer Antigen 125 (CA-125) and Human epididymis protein 4 (HE4). Microorganisms (bacterial, archaeal, and fungal cells) residing in mucosal tissues including the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts can be altered by different disease states, and these shifts in microbial dynamics may help to diagnose disease states. We hypothesized that the peritoneal microbial environment was altered in patients with OC and that inclusion of selected peritoneal microbial features with current clinical features into prediction analyses will improve detection accuracy of patients with OC. Blood and peritoneal fluid were collected from consented patients that had sonography confirmed adnexal masses and were being seen at SIU School of Medicine Simmons Cancer Institute. Blood was processed and serum HE4 and CA-125 were measured. Peritoneal fluid was collected at the time of surgery and processed for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) using 16S V4 exon bacterial primers and bioinformatics analyses. We found that patients with OC had a unique peritoneal microbial profile compared to patients with a benign mass. Using ensemble modeling and machine learning pathways, we identified 18 microbial features that were highly specific to OC pathology. Prediction analyses confirmed that inclusion of microbial features with serum tumor marker levels and control features (patient age and BMI) improved diagnostic accuracy compared to currently used models. We conclude that OC pathogenesis alters the peritoneal microbial environment and that these unique microbial features are important for accurate diagnosis of OC. Our study warrants further analyses of the importance of microbial features in regards to oncological diagnostics and possible prognostic and interventional medicine.","Bacteria, Archaea, Pathogen",,Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
28,2020,Microbial Diversity in High-Temperature Heavy Oil Reservoirs,"Abstract The microbial community in oil reservoirs plays important roles in carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen cycling. We identified the microbial composition, abundance, and diversity in two heavy oil wells (W1 and W2) located at Liaohe oilfield, China, that were flooded with higher temperatures, forming a decreasing gradient-temperature field (DGTF) from the steam chamber to the original surrounding formation. The two wells were connected to each other at a depth of 650 m and with temperatures of 249 °C (W1) and 259 °C (W2) in the steam chamber. Water and oil samples were collected from both wells, and 16S rRNA genes were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was 5499 and 5938 for W1 and W2, respectively, at 97% clustering. In both wells, the dominant bacterial phylum was Proteobacteria. Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota were the only two archaeal phyla detected. Terrimonas and Fluviicola were more abundant in the water sample W1–W, whereas Thermomonas, Nitrosomonas, and Sphingobacterium were more abundant in the oil sample W2-O. Aquificae was the only phylum detected in these wells that had not been detected in other oilfields. Excluding exogenous contamination, the results of this study showed abundant in-situ microbial diversity. The heavy oil reservoir has a large DGTF in higher temperature heavy oil reservoirs, potentially affecting the inner environment.","Bacteria, Archaea, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
29,2019,Fungal and Bacterial Communities Exhibit Consistent Responses to Reversal of Soil Acidification and Phosphorus Limitation over Time,"Chronic acid deposition affects many temperate hardwood forests of the northeastern United States, reduces soil pH and phosphorus (P) availability, and can alter the structure and function of soil microbial communities. The strategies that microorganisms possess for survival in acidic, low P soil come at a carbon (C) cost. Thus, how microbial communities respond to soil acidification in forests may be influenced by plant phenological stage as C allocation belowground varies; however, this remains largely unexplored. In this study, we examined microbial communities in an ecosystem level manipulative experiment where pH and/or P availability were elevated in three separate forests in Northeastern Ohio. Tag-encoded pyrosequencing was used to examine bacterial and fungal community structure at five time points across one year corresponding to plant phenological stages. We found significant effects of pH treatment and time on fungal and bacterial communities in soil. However, we found no interaction between pH treatment and time of sampling for fungal communities and only a weak interaction between pH elevation and time for bacterial communities, suggesting that microbial community responses to soil pH are largely independent of plant phenological stage. In addition, fungal communities were structured largely by site, suggesting that fungi were responding to differences between the forests, such as plant community differences.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome",,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
30,2019,Complementary DNA/RNA-Based Profiling: Characterization of Corrosive Microbial Communities and Their Functional Profiles in an Oil Production Facility,"DNA and RNA-based sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and transcripts were used to assess the phylogenetic diversity of microbial communities at assets experiencing corrosion in an oil production facility. The complementary methodological approach, coupled with extensive bioinformatics analysis, allowed to visualize differences between the total and potentially active communities present in several locations of the production facility. According to the results, taxa indicative for thermophiles and oil-degrading microorganisms decreased their relative abundances in the active communities, whereas sulfate reducing bacteria and methanogens had the opposite pattern. The differences in the diversity profile between total and active communities had an effect on the microbial functional capability predicted from the 16S rRNA sequences. Primarily, genes involved in methane metabolism were enriched in the RNA-based sequencing approach. Comparative analysis of microbial communities in the produced water, injection water and deposits in the pipelines showed that deposits host more individual species than other sample sources in the facility. Similarities in the number of cells and microbial profiles of active communities in biocide treated and untreated sampling locations suggested that the treatment was ineffective at controlling the growth of microbial populations with a known corrosive metabolism. Differences in the results between DNA and RNA-based profiling demonstrated that DNA results alone can lead to the underestimation of active members in the community, highlighting the importance of using a complementary approach to obtain a broad general overview not only of total and active members but also in the predicted functionality.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Comparative analysis",Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
31,2019,Differential basal expression of immune genes confers Crassostrea gigas resistance to Pacific oyster mortality syndrome,"As a major threat to the oyster industry, Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome (POMS) is a polymicrobial disease affecting the main oyster species farmed across the world. POMS affects oyster juveniles and became panzootic this last decade, but POMS resistance in some oyster genotypes has emerged. While we know some genetic loci associated with resistance, the underlying mechanisms remained uncharacterized. So, we developed a comparative transcriptomic approach using basal gene expression profiles between different oyster biparental families with contrasted phenotypes when confronted to POMS (resistant or susceptible). We showed that POMS resistant oysters show differential expression of genes involved in stress responses, protein modifications, maintenance of DNA integrity and repair, and immune and antiviral pathways. We found similarities and clear differences among different molecular pathways in the different resistant families. These results suggest that the resistance process is polygenic and partially varies according to the oyster genotype. We found differences in basal expression levels of genes related to TLR-NFκB, JAK-STAT and STING-RLR pathways. These differences could explain the best antiviral response, as well as the robustness of resistant oysters when confronted to POMS. As some of these genes represent valuable candidates for selective breeding, we propose future studies should further examine their function.",,"Functional analysis, AMR, Comparative analysis",(Meta)transcriptomics,Health & Disease
32,2019,Characterization of Core Microbiomes and Functional Profiles of Mesophilic Anaerobic Digesters Fed With Chlorella vulgaris Green Microalgae and Maize Silage,"Microalgal biomass is an alternative feedstock for biogas production although its C/N ratio is usually lower than optimal, therefore co-fermentation is recommended. Identification of the core microbiome by metagenome analysis and prediction of functional characteristics are essential to make microalgal feedstock more sustainable and economically feasible. Biogas production from photoautotrophically grown Chlorella vulgaris (Ch. vulgaris) biomass (240 mL CH4 g oTS-1) and co-fermentation with maize silage (330 mL CH4 g oTS-1) has been studied in semi continuous laboratory biogas fermenters. Maize silage control yielded 310 mL CH4 g oTS-1. The microbial community and the read-based functional profiles, derived from these data, were examined during the process by using next-generation metagenome Ion Torrent sequencing technology. The read-based core microbiome consisted of 92 genera from which 60 abundant taxa were directly associated with the microbial methane producing food chain. The data-set was also analyzed in a genome-based approach. 65 bins were assembled, 52 of them belonged in the core biogas producing genera identified by the read-based metagenomes. The read-based and genome-based approaches complemented and verified each other. The functional profiles indicated a variety of glycoside hydrolases. Substantial rearrangements of the methanogen functions have also been observed. Co-fermentation of algal biomass and plant biomass can be carried out for an extended period of time without process failure. The microbial members of the inoculum are well conserved, feedstock composition cause relative abundance changes in the core microbiome.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
33,2019,Impacts of environmental complexity on respiratory and gut microbiome community structure and diversity in growing pigs,"The limited understanding of the interaction between rearing environment of the growing pig and the pig’s microbial community impedes efforts to identify the optimal housing system to maximize animal health and production. Accordingly, we characterized the impact of housing complexity on shaping the respiratory and gut microbiota of growing pig. A total of 175 weaned pigs from 25 litters were randomly assigned within liter to either simple slatted-floor (S) or complex straw-based rearing ecosystem (C). Beside the floor swabs samples, fecal swabs and mucosal scraping samples from bronchus, ileum, and colon were collected approximately 164 days post-weaning at the time of slaughter. The S ecosystem seems to increase the α-diversity of respiratory and gut microbiota. Moreover, the C-raised pigs showed 35.4, 89.2, and 60.0% reduction in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio than the S-raised pigs at bronchus, ileum, and colon, respectively. The unfavorable taxa Psychrobacter, Corynebacterium, Actinobacteria, and Neisseria were the signature taxa of C environment-associated microbial community. Therefore, the microbiota of S-raised pigs seems to show higher density of the most essential and beneficial taxa than the C-raised pigs. We preliminarily conclude that increasing the physical complexity of rearing environment seems to provide suboptimal conditions for establishing a healthy microbial community in the growing pigs.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Interactome",,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
34,2019,Natural Microbial Communities Can Be Manipulated by Artificially Constructed Biofilms,"Biofouling proceeds in successive steps where the primary colonizers affect the phylogenetic and functional structure of a future microbial consortium. Using microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) as a study case, a novel approach for material surface protection is described, which does not prevent biofouling, but rather shapes the process of natural biofilm development to exclude MIC‐related microorganisms. This approach interferes with the early steps of natural biofilm formation affecting how the community is finally developed. It is based on a multilayer artificial biofilm, composed of electrostatically modified bacterial cells, producing antimicrobial compounds, extracellular antimicrobial polyelectrolyte matrix, and a water‐proof rubber elastomer barrier. The artificial biofilm is constructed layer‐by‐layer (LBL) by manipulating the electrostatic interactions between microbial cells and material surfaces. Field testing on standard steel coupons exposed in the sea for more than 30 days followed by laboratory analyses using molecular‐biology tools demonstrate that the preapplied artificial biofilm affects the phylogenetic structure of the developing natural biofilm, reducing phylogenetic diversity and excluding MIC‐related bacteria. This sustainable solution for material protection showcases the usefulness of artificially guiding microbial evolutionary processes via the electrostatic modification and controlled delivery of bacterial cells and extracellular matrix to the exposed material surfaces.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome, AMR",,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
35,2019,Surface sterilization methods impact measures of internal microbial diversity in ticks,"Ticks are obligate blood feeders transmitting major pathogens worldwide. Over the past few years, considerable research efforts have focused on the diversity, distribution and impact of gut and intracellular bacterial symbionts on tick development and tick-borne pathogen transmission. The study of this internal microbiome requires the use of a sterilization method to remove external (i.e. cuticular) microbes present on the tick’s surface and to avoid any further contamination. Several sterilization methods exist, including ethanol- or bleach-based treatments that are both effective in killing microbes but with different potential effects on DNA denaturation. We examined how these different sterilization methods impact the measure of internal microbial diversity hosted by the Cayenne tick Amblyomma cajennense (sensu stricto). Bacterial barcoding investigations based on 16S rRNA gene sequences were conducted on two batches of 50 individuals each: Ticks of the first batch were sterilized with bleach diluted at 1% and the second batch with 70% ethanol. Tick external microbiome was also determined from cuticle smearing and water samples used for tick washing. Bacterial barcoding investigations showed major differences between ethanol- and bleach-treated specimens. Both methods led to the detection of major intracellular bacteria associated with A. cajennense (s.s.) but ethanol-treated ticks always harbored a higher bacterial diversity than bleach-treated ticks. Further examinations of tick gut and tick external microbiome revealed that ethanol-based surface sterilization method is inefficient to eliminate the DNA of external bacteria. We herein provide evidence that studies investigating the internal microbiome of ticks should consider bleach as the gold standard to efficiently remove cuticular bacterial DNA. Indeed, this method does not impact the internal bacterial diversity hosted by ticks and is thus a better method than the ethanol-based one for studying the internal microbiome.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

37,2019,Changes in Bacterioplankton Communities Resulting From Direct and Indirect Interactions With Trace Metal Gradients in an Urbanized Marine Coastal Area,"Unraveling the relative importance of both environmental conditions and ecological processes regulating bacterioplankton communities is a central goal in microbial ecology. Marine coastal environments are among the most urbanized areas and as a consequence experience environmental pressures. The highly anthropized Toulon Bay (France) was considered as a model system to investigate shifts in bacterioplankton communities along natural and anthropogenic physicochemical gradients during a 1-month survey. In depth geochemical characterization mainly revealed strong and progressive Cd, Zn, Cu, and Pb contamination gradients between the entrance of the Bay and the north-western anthropized area. On the other hand, low-amplitude natural gradients were observed for other environmental variables. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we observed strong spatial patterns in bacterioplankton taxonomic and predicted function structure along the chemical contamination gradient. Variation partitioning analysis demonstrated that multiple metallic contamination explained the largest part of the spatial biological variations observed, but DOC and salinity were also significant contributors. Network analysis revealed that biotic interactions were far more numerous than direct interactions between microbial groups and environmental variables. This suggests indirect effects of the environment, and especially trace metals, on the community through a few taxonomic groups. These spatial patterns were also partially found for predicted bacterioplankton functions, thus indicating a limited functional redundancy. All these results highlight both potential direct influences of trace metals contamination on coastal bacterioplankton and indirect forcing through biotic interactions and cascading.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome",Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

39,2019,Functional screening for triclosan resistance in a wastewater metagenome and isolates of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. from a large Canadian healthcare region,"The biocide triclosan is in many consumer products and is a frequent contaminant of wastewater (WW) such that there is concern that triclosan promotes resistance to important antibiotics. This study identified functional mechanisms of triclosan resistance (TCSR) in WW metagenomes, and assessed the frequency of TCSR in WW-derived and clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. Metagenomic DNA extracted from WW was used to profile the microbiome and construct large-insert cosmid libraries, which were screened for TCSR. Resistant cosmids were sequenced and the TCSR determinant identified by transposon mutagenesis. Wastewater Enterococcus spp. (N = 94) and E. coli (N = 99) and clinical Enterococcus spp. (N = 146) and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VRE; N = 149) were collected and tested for resistance to triclosan and a comprehensive drug panel. Functional metagenomic screening revealed diverse FabV homologs as major WW TCSR determinants. Resistant clones harboured sequences likely originating from Aeromonas spp., a common WW microbe. The triclosan MIC90s for E. coli, E. faecalis, and E. faecium isolates were 0.125, 32, and 32 mg/L, respectively. For E. coli, there was no correlation between the triclosan MIC and any drug tested. Negative correlations were detected between the triclosan MIC and levofloxacin resistance for E. faecalis, and between triclosan and vancomycin, teicoplanin, and ampicillin resistance for E. faecium. Thus, FabV homologs were the major contributor to the WW triclosan resistome and high-level TCSR was not observed in WW or clinical isolates. Elevated triclosan MICs were not positively correlated with antimicrobial resistance to any drug tested.",Microbiome,"Isolate, Functional analysis, AMR","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
40,2019,Dysbiosis of the Gut Microbiota on the Inflammatory Background due to Lack of Suppressor of Cytokine Signalling-1 in Mice,"Background: Both environmental and genetic factors have been implicated in the induction of autoimmune disease. Therefore, it is important to understand the pathophysiological significance of the gut microbiota and host genetic background that contribute to an autoimmune disease such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We have previously reported that mice deficient for suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS1), in which SOCS1 expression was restored in T and B cells on an SOCS1–/– background (SOCS1–/–Tg mice), developed systemic autoimmune diseases accompanied by spontaneous colitis. Methods: To investigate whether the proinflammatory genetic background affects the gut microbiota, we used SOCS1–/–Tg mice as a model of spontaneous chronic colitis. Fecal samples were collected from SOCS1–/–Tg mice and SOCS1+/+Tg (control) mice at 1 and 6 months of age, and the fecal bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Results: Gut microbial diversity was significantly reduced and the intestinal bacterial community composition changed in SOCS1–/–Tg mice in comparison with the control mice. Interestingly, the population of Prevotella species, which is known to be elevated in ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer patients, was significantly increased in SOCS1–/–Tg mice regardless of age. Conclusion: Taken together, these results suggest that the proinflammatory genetic background owing to SOCS1 deficiency causes dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, which in turn generates a procolitogenic environment.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
41,2019,Exploring the Human Microbiome: The Potential Future Role of Next-Generation Sequencing in Disease Diagnosis and Treatment,"The interaction between the human microbiome and immune system has an effect on several human metabolic functions and impacts our well-being. Additionally, the interaction between humans and microbes can also play a key role in determining the wellness or disease status of the human body. Dysbiosis is related to a plethora of diseases, including skin, inflammatory, metabolic, and neurological disorders. A better understanding of the host-microbe interaction is essential for determining the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of these ailments. The significance of the microbiome on host health has led to the emergence of new therapeutic approaches focused on the prescribed manipulation of the host microbiome, either by removing harmful taxa or reinstating missing beneficial taxa and the functional roles they perform. Culturing large numbers of microbial taxa in the laboratory is problematic at best, if not impossible. Consequently, this makes it very difficult to comprehensively catalog the individual members comprising a specific microbiome, as well as understanding how microbial communities function and influence host-pathogen interactions. Recent advances in sequencing technologies and computational tools have allowed an increasing number of metagenomic studies to be performed. These studies have provided key insights into the human microbiome and a host of other microbial communities in other environments. In the present review, the role of the microbiome as a therapeutic agent and its significance in human health and disease is discussed. Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies for surveying host-microbe interactions are also discussed. Additionally, the correlation between the composition of the microbiome and infectious diseases as described in previously reported studies is covered as well.

42,2018,Developing reproducible bioinformatics analysis workflows for heterogeneous computing environments to support African genomics,"The Pan-African bioinformatics network, H3ABioNet, comprises 27 research institutions in 17 African countries. H3ABioNet is part of the Human Health and Heredity in Africa program (H3Africa), an African-led research consortium funded by the US National Institutes of Health and the UK Wellcome Trust, aimed at using genomics to study and improve the health of Africans. A key role of H3ABioNet is to support H3Africa projects by building bioinformatics infrastructure such as portable and reproducible bioinformatics workflows for use on heterogeneous African computing environments. Processing and analysis of genomic data is an example of a big data application requiring complex interdependent data analysis workflows. Such bioinformatics workflows take the primary and secondary input data through several computationally-intensive processing steps using different software packages, where some of the outputs form inputs for other steps. Implementing scalable, reproducible, portable and easy-to-use workflows is particularly challenging. H3ABioNet has built four workflows to support (1) the calling of variants from high-throughput sequencing data; (2) the analysis of microbial populations from 16S rDNA sequence data; (3) genotyping and genome-wide association studies; and (4) single nucleotide polymorphism imputation. A week-long hackathon was organized in August 2016 with participants from six African bioinformatics groups, and US and European collaborators. Two of the workflows are built using the Common Workflow Language framework (CWL) and two using Nextflow. All the workflows are containerized for improved portability and reproducibility using Docker, and are publicly available for use by members of the H3Africa consortium and the international research community. The H3ABioNet workflows have been implemented in view of offering ease of use for the end user and high levels of reproducibility and portability, all while following modern state of the art bioinformatics data processing protocols. The H3ABioNet workflows will service the H3Africa consortium projects and are currently in use. All four workflows are also publicly available for research scientists worldwide to use and adapt for their respective needs. The H3ABioNet workflows will help develop bioinformatics capacity and assist genomics research within Africa and serve to increase the scientific output of H3Africa and its Pan-African Bioinformatics Network.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, Variant","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
43,2018,Intestinal Microbiome in Irritable Bowel Syndrome before and after Gut-Directed Hypnotherapy,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder with brain-gut-microbiome alterations. Gut-directed hypnotherapy (GHT) has been shown to improve quality of life and symptoms in IBS. This therapy targets psychological coping, central nervous processing and brain-gut interaction. Studies have also demonstrated effects of hypnosis on intestinal transit and the mucosal immune system. So far, no study has examined the effect of GHT on the intestinal microbiome. This study aimed at examining microbial composition, IBS symptoms, and psychological distress before and after GHT. Methods: Fecal samples were collected from 38 IBS patients (Rome-III criteria, mean age 44 years, 27 female, 11 male, 22 diarrhea-dominant, 12 alternating-type and 4 constipation-dominant IBS) before and after 10 weekly group sessions of GHT. Assessments in psychological (perceived stress, PSQ; psychological distress, HADS-D; quality of life, visual analogue scales) and IBS symptom-related variables (IBS severity, IBS-SSS; single symptoms, visual analogue scales) were performed with validated questionnaires. Fecal samples underwent microbial 16S rRNA analyses (regions V1–2). Results: Microbial alpha diversity was stable before and after GHT (chao1 2591 ± 548 vs. 2581 ± 539, p = 0.92). No significant differences were found in relative bacterial abundances but trends of reduced abundance of Lachnospiraceae 32.18 (4.14–39.89) Median (Q1–Q3) vs. 28.11 (22.85; 35.55) and Firmicutes: Bacteroidetes ratio after GHT were observable. Significant reductions in symptom severity (323 (266–371) vs. 264 (191–331), p = 0.001) and psychological distress 17.0 (12.6–21.8) vs. 12.0 (8.3–18.0), p = 0.001, and increased well-being were found after GHT. Adequate relief after therapy was reported by 32 (84%) patients. Conclusion: Reductions in IBS symptoms and psychological burden were observed after gut-directed hypnotherapy, but only small changes were found in intestinal microbiota composition. The findings suggest that hypnosis may act by central nervous impact and other factors largely independent from microbiota composition modulating the brain-gut axis, possibly alterations in vagus nerve functioning and microbiota metabolism.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome",Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
44,2018,"Monitoring of microbial dynamics in a drinking water distribution system using the culture-free, user-friendly, MYcrobiota platform","Drinking water utilities currently rely on a range of microbiological detection techniques to evaluate the quality of their drinking water (DW). However, microbiota profiling using culture-free 16S rRNA gene next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides an opportunity for improved monitoring of the microbial ecology and quality of DW. Here, we evaluated the utility of a previously validated microbiota profiling platform (MYcrobiota) to investigate the microbial dynamics of a full-scale, non-chlorinated DW distribution system (DWDS). In contrast to conventional methods, we observed spatial and temporal bacterial genus changes (expressed as operational taxonomic units - OTUs) within the DWDS. Further, a small subset of bacterial OTUs dominated with abundances that shifted across the length of the DWDS, and were particularly affected by a post-disinfection step. We also found seasonal variation in OTUs within the DWDS and that many OTUs could not be identified, even though MYcrobiota is specifically designed to reduce potential PCR sequencing artefacts. This suggests that our current knowledge about the microbial ecology of DW communities is limited. Our findings demonstrate that the user-friendly MYcrobiota platform facilitates culture-free, standardized microbial dynamics monitoring and has the capacity to facilitate the introduction of microbiota profiling into the management of drinking water quality.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
45,2018,A Microbial Signature of Psychological Distress in Irritable Bowel Syndrome,"Objective Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is associated with alterations along the brain-gut-microbiota axis. Previous studies have suggested a parallel segregation of microbial features and psychological burden in IBS. This study aimed at exploring the microbial correlates of psychological distress in patients with IBS. Methods Forty-eight patients with IBS (Rome III criteria, M (SD) age = 42 (15) years, 35 female, 25 diarrhea-dominant, 5 constipation-dominant, and 18 alternating-type IBS) were assessed for psychological and clinical variables with validated questionnaires, fecal samples underwent microbial 16S rRNA analyses (regions V1–2). Microbial analyses comprised examination of alpha and beta diversity, correlational analyses of bacterial abundance and comparisons among subgroups defined by thresholds of psychological and IBS symptom variables, and machine learning to identify bacterial patterns corresponding with psychological distress. Results Thirty-one patients (65%) showed elevated psychological distress, 22 (31%) anxiety, and 10 depression (21%). Microbial beta diversity was significantly associated with distress and depression (q = .036 each, q values are p values false discovery rate–corrected for multiple testing). Depression was negatively associated with Lachnospiraceae abundance (Spearman's &rgr; = −0.58, q = .018). Patients exceeding thresholds of distress, anxiety, depression, and stress perception showed significantly higher abundances of Proteobacteria (q = .020–.036). Patients with anxiety were characterized by elevated Bacteroidaceae (q = .036). A signature of 148 unclassified species accounting for 3.9% of total bacterial abundance co-varied systematically with the presence of psychological distress. Conclusions Psychological variables significantly segregated gut microbial features, underscoring the role of brain-gut-microbiota interaction in IBS. A microbial signature corresponding with psychological distress was identified.

46,2018,Spfy: an integrated graph database for real-time prediction of bacterial phenotypes and downstream comparative analyses,"Abstract Public health laboratories are currently moving to whole-genome sequence (WGS)-based analyses, and require the rapid prediction of standard reference laboratory methods based solely on genomic data. Currently, these predictive genomics tasks rely on workflows that chain together multiple programs for the requisite analyses. While useful, these systems do not store the analyses in a genome-centric way, meaning the same analyses are often re-computed for the same genomes. To solve this problem, we created Spfy, a platform that rapidly performs the common reference laboratory tests, uses a graph database to store and retrieve the results from the computational workflows and links data to individual genomes using standardized ontologies. The Spfy platform facilitates rapid phenotype identification, as well as the efficient storage and downstream comparative analysis of tens of thousands of genome sequences. Though generally applicable to bacterial genome sequences, Spfy currently contains 10 243 Escherichia coli genomes, for which in-silico serotype and Shiga-toxin subtype, as well as the presence of known virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance determinants have been computed. Additionally, the presence/absence of the entire E. coli pan-genome was computed and linked to each genome. Owing to its database of diverse pre-computed results, and the ability to easily incorporate user data, Spfy facilitates hypothesis testing in fields ranging from population genomics to epidemiology, while mitigating the re-computation of analyses. The graph approach of Spfy is flexible, and can accommodate new analysis software modules as they are developed, easily linking new results to those already stored. Spfy provides a database and analyses approach for E. coli that is able to match the rapid accumulation of WGS data in public databases.",Bacteria,"AMR, Comparative analysis",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease
47,2018,SuperPhy - A Pilot Resource for Integrated Phylogenetic and Epidemiological Analysis of Pathogens,"Advances in DNA sequencing technology have created new opportunities in fields such as clinical medicine and epidemiology, where performing real-time, genome-based surveillance and identification of phenotypic characteristics of bacterial pathogens is now possible. New analytical tools and infrastructure are needed to analyze these genomic datasets, store the data, and provide the essential biological information to end-users. We have implemented an online whole-genome analyses platform called SuperPhy that uses Panseq as an engine to compare bacterial genomes, the Fisher’s exact test to identify sub-group specific loci, and FastTree to create maximum-likelihood trees. SuperPhy facilitates the upload of genomes for both private and public use. Analyses include: 1) genomic comparisons of clinical isolates, and identification of virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes in silico, 2) associations between specific genotypes and phenotypic meta-data (e.g., geospatial distribution, host, source); 3) identification of group-specific genome markers (presence/ absence of specific genomic regions, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms) in bacterial populations; 4) the ability to manipulate the display of phylogenetic trees; 5) identify statistically significant clade-specific markers. The SuperPhy pilot database currently contains genome sequences for 1063 Escherichia colistrains. Future work will extend SuperPhy to include multiple pathogens.","Bacteria, Pathogen","Isolate, AMR, SNP",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
48,2018,Identification of Bisphenol A-Assimilating Microorganisms in Mixed Microbial Communities Using 13C-DNA Stable Isotope Probing.,"A wide range of trace organic contaminants (TOrCs), including the endocrine-disrupting compound bisphenol A (BPA), are subject to microbial transformations during biological wastewater treatment. However, relatively little is known about the identity of organisms capable of assimilating emerging contaminants. Here, 13C-DNA stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) was used to investigate biodegradation and assimilation of BPA by mixed microbial communities collected from two full-scale wastewater treatment plant bioreactors in New York City and subsequently enriched under two BPA exposure conditions. The four enrichment modes (two reactors with two initial BPA concentrations) resulted in four distinct communities with different BPA degradation rates. On the basis of DNA-SIP, bacteria related to Sphingobium spp. were dominant in the assimilation of BPA or its metabolites. Variovorax spp. and Pusillimonas spp. also assimilated BPA or its metabolites. Our results highlight that microbial communities originating from wastewater treatment facilities harbor the potential for addressing not only human-derived carbon but also BPA, a complex anthropogenic TOrC. While previous studies focus on microbial biodegradation of BPA, this study uniquely determines the ""active"" fraction of microorganisms engaged in assimilation of BPA-derived carbon. Ultimately, information on both biodegradation and assimilation can facilitate better design and operation of engineered treatment processes to achieve BPA removal.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabolomics,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
49,2018,Electron acceptors for anaerobic oxidation of methane drive microbial community structure and diversity in mud volcanoes,"Mud volcanoes (MVs) emit globally significant quantities of methane into the atmosphere, however, methane cycling in such environments is not yet fully understood, as the roles of microbes and their associated biogeochemical processes have been largely overlooked. Here, we used data from high-throughput sequencing of microbial 16S rRNA gene amplicons from six MVs in the Junggar Basin in northwest China to quantify patterns of diversity and characterize the community structure of archaea and bacteria. We found anaerobic methanotrophs and diverse sulfate- and iron-reducing microbes in all of the samples, and the diversity of both archaeal and bacterial communities was strongly linked to the concentrations of sulfate, iron and nitrate, which could act as electron acceptors in anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). The impacts of sulfate/iron/nitrate on AOM in the MVs were verified by microcosm experiments. Further, two representative MVs were selected to explore the microbial interactions based on phylogenetic molecular ecological networks. The sites showed distinct network structures, key species and microbial interactions, with more complex and numerous linkages between methane-cycling microbes and their partners being observed in the iron/sulfate-rich MV. These findings suggest that electron acceptors are important factors driving the structure of microbial communities in these methane-rich environments.","Bacteria, Archaea, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Interactome",Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
50,2018,Understanding trivial challenges of microbial genomics: An assembly example,"The perceived “simplicity” of bacterial genomics (these genomes are small and easy to assemble) feeds the decentralized state of the field where computational analysis standards have been slow to evolve. This situation has a historical explanation. In cases of human, mouse, fly, worm and other model organisms there have been large sustained multinational genome sequencing efforts and analysis consortia such as the 1,000 genomes, ENCODE, modENCODE, GTEx and others. These resulted in development and proliferation of common tools, workflows, and data standards. This is not the case in microbiology. After the development of highly parallel sequencing methodologies in mid-2000s bacterial genomes no longer required initiatives of such scale. The flipside of this is the extreme heterogeneity of approaches to many well established microbial genomic analysis problems such as genome assembly. While competition amongst different methods is good, we argue that the quality of data analyses will improve if cutting edge tools are more accessible and microbiologists become more computationally savvy. Here we use genome assembly as an example to highlight current challenges and to provide a possible solution.",Bacteria,MAGs,(Meta)genomics,

Metagenome analysis, the assignment of sequences to taxonomic and functional entities, however, remains a tedious task: large amounts of data need to be processed. There are a number of approaches addressing particular aspects, but scientific questions are often too specific to be answered by a general-purpose method.

At the same time, MGX allows to include own data sources and devise custom analysis pipelines, thus enabling researchers to perform basic as well as highly specific analyses within a single application. With MGX, we provide a novel metagenome analysis platform giving researchers access to the most recent analysis tools.

54,2018,Streptococcal Lancefield polysaccharides are critical cell wall determinants for human Group IIA secreted phospholipase A2 to exert its bactericidal effects,"Human Group IIA secreted phospholipase A2 (hGIIA) is an acute phase protein with bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Infection models in hGIIA transgenic mice have suggested the importance of hGIIA as an innate defense mechanism against the human pathogens Group A Streptococcus (GAS) and Group B Streptococcus (GBS). Compared to other Gram-positive bacteria, GAS is remarkably resistant to hGIIA activity. To identify GAS resistance mechanisms, we exposed a highly saturated GAS M1 transposon library to recombinant human hGIIA and compared relative mutant abundance with library input through transposon-sequencing (Tn-seq). Based on transposon prevalence in the output library, we identified nine genes, including dltA and lytR, conferring increased hGIIA susceptibility. In addition, seven genes conferred increased hGIIA resistance, which included two genes, gacH and gacI that are located within the Group A Carbohydrate (GAC) gene cluster. Using GAS 5448 wild-type and the isogenic gacI mutant and gacI-complemented strains, we demonstrate that loss of the GAC N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) side chain in the ΔgacI mutant increases hGIIA resistance approximately 10-fold, a phenotype that is conserved across different GAS serotypes. Increased resistance is associated with delayed penetration of hGIIA through the cell wall. Correspondingly, loss of the Lancefield Group B Carbohydrate (GBC) rendered GBS significantly more resistant to hGIIA-mediated killing. This suggests that the streptococcal Lancefield antigens, which are critical determinants for streptococcal physiology and virulence, are required for the human bactericidal enzyme hGIIA to exert its bactericidal function. Author summary The human immune system is capable of killing invading bacteria by secreting antimicrobial proteins. Cationic human Group IIA secreted phospholipase A2 (hGIIA) is especially effective against Gram-positive bacteria by degrading the bacterial membrane. HGIIA requires binding to negatively charged surface structures before it can penetrate through the thick peptidoglycan layer and reach the target phospholipid membrane. HGIIA is constitutively expressed at high concentrations at sites of possible bacterial entry, e.g. in tears, skin and small intestine. In serum, normal concentrations are low but can increase up to 1,000-fold upon inflammation or infection. In vitro, ex vivo and in vivo experiments suggest an important role for hGIIA in defense against two human pathogens, Group A and Group B Streptococcus (GAS, GBS). We demonstrate that the Lancefield cell wall polysaccharides that are expressed by these bacteria, the Group A Carbohydrate (GAC) for GAS and the Group B Carbohydrate (GBC) for GBS, are required for optimal hGIIA bactericidal efficacy by facilitating penetration through the peptidoglycan layer. Given the increased hGIIA resistance of antigen-modified or antigen-deficient streptococci, it will be of interest to determine potential regulatory mechanisms regarding expression of streptococcal Lancefield polysaccharides.","Bacteria, Pathogen","Functional analysis, AMR",,Health & Disease
55,2018,Western Indian Rural Gut Microbial Diversity in Extreme Prakriti Endo-Phenotypes Reveals Signature Microbes,"Heterogeneity amidst healthy individuals at genomic level is being widely acknowledged. This, in turn, is modulated by differential response to environmental cues and treatment regimens, necessitating the need for stratified/personalized therapy. We intend to understand the molecular determinants of Ayurvedic way (ancient Indian system of medicine) of endo-phenotyping individuals into distinct constitution types termed “Prakriti,” which forms the basis of personalized treatment. In this study, we explored and analyzed the healthy human gut microbiome structure within three predominant Prakriti groups from a genetically homogenous cohort to discover differentially abundant taxa, using 16S rRNA gene based microbial community profiling. We found Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes as major gut microbial components in varying composition, albeit with similar trend across Prakriti. Multiple species of the core microbiome showed differential abundance within Prakriti types, with gender specific signature taxons. Our study reveals that despite overall uniform composition of gut microbial community, healthy individuals belonging to different Prakriti groups have enrichment of specific bacteria. It highlights the importance of Prakriti based endo-phenotypes to explain the variability amongst healthy individuals in gut microbial flora that have important consequences for an individual's health, disease and treatment.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,"Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

58,2017,Relationship between Gingival Crevicular Fluid Microbiota and Cytokine Profile in Periodontal Host Homeostasis,"As potential biomarkers in periodontitis, microbiome, and cytokines have recently been extensively investigated, but combined analyses of the variations between the microbial structure and cytokine composition are rare. The present study aimed to investigate whether there are differences in the combined profile of microbiome and cytokines in individuals with or without periodontitis. The microbiome and cytokine composition in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) from 16 patients and 15 controls from Jishi Shan (Gansu, China) were analyzed using 454 pyrosequencing and RayBio Quantibody Arrays. The results showed that a higher co-occurrence of genera in periodontitis group compared with the healthy group, as evaluated by Schoener's abundance-based co-occurrence index. C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the GCF of the periodontitis group while interleukin (IL)-8 was significantly (P < 0.01) higher in the GCF of the healthy group. The Mantel test revealed a significant concordance between cytokines and microbiota, in the healthy group (Mantel statistic r = 0.36, P ≤ 0.05) but not in the periodontitis group (Mantel statistic r = 0.013, P = 0.434). The results were further confirmed by the Procrustes test. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, osteoactivin, IL-8, and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1a were significantly associated with bacterial composition at the phylum, class, order, family, and genus levels. CRP was also associated with bacterial composition at the species level. In conclusion, alterations in the polymicrobial community structure leads to disruption in the healthy correlation between cytokines and microbiomes. This dysbiosis between the microbiota and the immune response could be one of the major etiological mechanisms underlying periodontitis.","Bacteria, Virus, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Gene identification / Biomarker",,Health & Disease
59,2017,Lineage overwhelms environmental conditions in determining rhizosphere bacterial community structure in a cosmopolitan invasive plant,"Plant–microbe interactions play crucial roles in species invasions but are rarely investigated at the intraspecific level. Here, we study these interactions in three lineages of a globally distributed plant, Phragmites australis. We use field surveys and a common garden experiment to analyze bacterial communities in the rhizosphere of P. australis stands from native, introduced, and Gulf lineages to determine lineage-specific controls on rhizosphere bacteria. We show that within-lineage bacterial communities are similar, but are distinct among lineages, which is consistent with our results in a complementary common garden experiment. Introduced P. australis rhizosphere bacterial communities have lower abundances of pathways involved in antimicrobial biosynthesis and degradation, suggesting a lower exposure to enemy attack than native and Gulf lineages. However, lineage and not rhizosphere bacterial communities dictate individual plant growth in the common garden experiment. We conclude that lineage is crucial for determination of both rhizosphere bacterial communities and plant fitness.Environmental factors often outweigh host heritable factors in structuring host-associated microbiomes. Here, Bowen et al. show that host lineage is crucial for determination of rhizosphere bacterial communities in Phragmites australis, a globally distributed invasive plant.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Interactome, AMR",,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
60,2017,Strand-specific transcriptomes of Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli in response to interactions with ground beef microbiota: interactions between microorganisms in raw meat,"Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) are zoonotic agents associated with outbreaks worldwide. Growth of EHEC strains in ground beef could be inhibited by background microbiota that is present initially at levels greater than that of the pathogen E. coli. However, how the microbiota outcompetes the pathogenic bacteria is unknown. Our objective was to identify metabolic pathways of EHEC that were altered by natural microbiota in order to improve our understanding of the mechanisms controlling the growth and survival of EHECs in ground beef. Based on 16S metagenomics analysis, we identified the microbial community structure in our beef samples which was an essential preliminary for subtractively analyzing the gene expression of the EHEC strains. Then, we applied strand-specific RNA-seq to investigate the effects of this microbiota on the global gene expression of EHEC O2621765 and O157EDL933 strains by comparison with their behavior in beef meat without microbiota. In strain O2621765, the expression of genes connected with nitrate metabolism and nitrite detoxification, DNA repair, iron and nickel acquisition and carbohydrate metabolism, and numerous genes involved in amino acid metabolism were down-regulated. Further, the observed repression of ftsL and murF, involved respectively in building the cytokinetic ring apparatus and in synthesizing the cytoplasmic precursor of cell wall peptidoglycan, might help to explain the microbiota’s inhibitory effect on EHECs. For strain O157EDL933, the induced expression of the genes implicated in detoxification and the general stress response and the repressed expression of the peR gene, a gene negatively associated with the virulence phenotype, might be linked to the survival and virulence of O157:H7 in ground beef with microbiota. In the present study, we show how RNA-Seq coupled with a 16S metagenomics analysis can be used to identify the effects of a complex microbial community on relevant functions of an individual microbe within it. These findings add to our understanding of the behavior of EHECs in ground beef. By measuring transcriptional responses of EHEC, we could identify putative targets which may be useful to develop new strategies to limit their shedding in ground meat thus reducing the risk of human illnesses.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics, (Meta)transcriptomics",Health & Disease
61,2017,The novel fungal-specific gene FUG1 has a role in pathogenicity and fumonisin biosynthesis in Fusarium verticillioides.,"Fusarium verticillioides is a globally important pathogen of maize, capable of causing severe yield reductions and economic losses. In addition, F. verticillioides produces toxic secondary metabolites during kernel colonization that pose significant threats to human and animal health. Fusarium verticillioides and other plant-pathogenic fungi possess a large number of genes with no known or predicted function, some of which could encode novel virulence factors or antifungal targets. In this study, we identified and characterized the novel gene FUG1 (Fungal Unknown Gene 1) in F. verticillioides through functional genetics. Deletion of FUG1 impaired maize kernel colonization and fumonisin biosynthesis. In addition, deletion of FUG1 increased sensitivity to the antimicrobial compound 2-benzoxazolinone and to hydrogen peroxide, which indicates that FUG1 may play a role in mitigating stresses associated with host defence. Transcriptional profiling via RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) identified numerous fungal genes that were differentially expressed in the kernel environment following the deletion of FUG1, including genes involved in secondary metabolism and mycelial development. Sequence analysis of the Fug1 protein provided evidence for nuclear localization, DNA binding and a domain of unknown function associated with previously characterized transcriptional regulators. This information, combined with the observed transcriptional reprogramming in the deletion mutant, suggests that FUG1 represents a novel class of fungal transcription factors or genes otherwise involved in signal transduction.",Pathogen,"Functional analysis, AMR",Metabolomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

Feces from puppies were collected at 2, 21, 42, and 56 days after birth. Feces were also collected from the puppies’ mothers at a single time point within 24 hours after parturition. DNA was extracted from fecal samples and 454-pyrosequencing was used to profile 16S rRNA genes. Species richness continued to increase significantly from 2 days of age until 42 days of age in puppies. Furthermore, microbial communities clustered separately from each other at 2, 21, and 42 days of age. The microbial communities belonging to dams clustered separately from that of puppies at any given time point. Major phylogenetic changes were noted at all taxonomic levels with the most profound changes being a shift from primarily Firmicutes in puppies at 2 days of age to a co-dominance of Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, and Firmicutes by 21 days of age.

A rapid increase in sequencing capabilities and bioinformatics tools has significantly increased the potential for VFAR-based analyses. This review summarizes more than 20 bioinformatics databases and tools, developed over the last decade, along with their virulence and antimicrobial resistance prediction capabilities. With the number of bacterial whole genome sequences exceeding 241 000 and metagenomic analysis projects exceeding 13 000 and the ability to add additional genome sequences for few hundred dollars, it is evident that further development of VFARs is not limited by the availability of information at least at the genomic level. However, additional information related to co-occurrence, treatment response, modulation of virulence due to environmental and other factors, and economic impact must be gathered and incorporated in a manner that also addresses the associated uncertainties. Of the bioinformatics tools, a majority are either designed exclusively for virulence/resistance determination or equipped with a dedicated module. The remaining have the potential to be employed for evaluating virulence. This review focusing broadly on omics technologies and tools supports the notion that these tools are now sufficiently developed to allow the application of VFAR approaches combined with additional engineering and economic analyses to rank and prioritize organisms important to a given niche. Knowledge gaps do exist but can be filled with focused experimental and theoretical analyses that were unimaginable a decade ago.

65,2017,Removing the needle from the haystack: Enrichment of Wolbachia endosymbiont transcripts from host nematode RNA by Cappable-seq™,"Efficient transcriptomic sequencing of microbial mRNA derived from host-microbe associations is often compromised by the much lower relative abundance of microbial RNA in the mixed total RNA sample. One solution to this problem is to perform extensive sequencing until an acceptable level of transcriptome coverage is obtained. More cost-effective methods include use of prokaryotic and/or eukaryotic rRNA depletion strategies, sometimes in conjunction with depletion of polyadenylated eukaryotic mRNA. Here, we report use of Cappable-seq™ to specifically enrich, in a single step, Wolbachia endobacterial mRNA transcripts from total RNA prepared from the parasitic filarial nematode, Brugia malayi. The obligate Wolbachia endosymbiont is a proven drug target for many human filarial infections, yet the precise nature of its symbiosis with the nematode host is poorly understood. Insightful analysis of the expression levels of Wolbachia genes predicted to underpin the mutualistic association and of known drug target genes at different life cycle stages or in response to drug treatments is typically challenged by low transcriptomic coverage. Cappable-seq resulted in up to ~ 5-fold increase in the number of reads mapping to Wolbachia. On average, coverage of Wolbachia transcripts from B. malayi microfilariae was enriched ~40-fold by Cappable-seq. Additionally, this method has an additional benefit of selectively removing abundant prokaryotic ribosomal RNAs.The deeper microbial transcriptome sequencing afforded by Cappable-seq facilitates more detailed characterization of gene expression levels of pathogens and symbionts present in animal tissues.","Bacteria, Eukaryote, Pathogen",,(Meta)transcriptomics,Health & Disease

The ecological success of these populations is likely associated with the diverse microbial interactions occurring within the Trichodesmium holobiont, especially between Trichodesmium and heterotrophic bacterial epibionts. Yet, the composition of the Trichodesmium holobiont and the processes governing microbial assemblage are not well documented. Here, we used high-resolution 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing to examine the diversity of Trichodesmium and associated epibionts across different ocean regions and colony morphologies (puffs and rafts). Trichodesmium Clade I (i.e., T. thiebautii-like) dominated the colonies in all ocean basins regardless of morphology, although the Trichodesmium community structure significantly varied between morphologies in some regions. On average, Alphaproteobacteria (i.e., Thalassobius), Gammaproteobacteria (i.e., Pseudoalteromonas), Sphingobacteria (i.e., Microscilla and Vibrio) and Flavobacteria dominated the epibiont communities, but community composition and structure significantly differed between regions. Epibionts from the two colony morphologies were taxonomically and functionally distinct in the North Atlantic and North Pacific. These findings suggest that the colony types might define two distinct niches and that epibiont assemblage might be driven in part by selective processes, where epibionts are selected according to their influence on colony metabolism.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome",Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
72,2016,"Microbial communities and their predicted metabolic characteristics in deep fracture groundwaters of the crystalline bedrock at Olkiluoto, Finland","Abstract. The microbial diversity in oligotrophic isolated crystalline Fennoscandian Shield bedrock fracture groundwaters is high, but the core community has not been identified. Here we characterized the bacterial and archaeal communities in 12 water conductive fractures situated at depths between 296 and 798 m by high throughput amplicon sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Between 1.7  ×  104 and 1.2  ×  106 bacterial or archaeal sequence reads per sample were obtained. These sequences revealed that up to 95 and 99 % of the bacterial and archaeal sequences obtained from the 12 samples, respectively, belonged to only a few common species, i.e. the core microbiome. However, the remaining rare microbiome contained over 3- and 6-fold more bacterial and archaeal taxa. The metabolic properties of the microbial communities were predicted using PICRUSt. The approximate estimation showed that the metabolic pathways commonly included fermentation, fatty acid oxidation, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and methanogenesis/anaerobic methane oxidation, but carbon fixation through the Calvin cycle, reductive TCA cycle, and the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway was also predicted. The rare microbiome is an unlimited source of genomic functionality in all ecosystems. It may consist of remnants of microbial communities prevailing in earlier environmental conditions, but could also be induced again if changes in their living conditions occur.","Bacteria, Archaea, Microbiome","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
73,2016,Effects of Elevated Tropospheric Ozone Concentration on the Bacterial Community in the Phyllosphere and Rhizoplane of Rice,"Microbes constitute a vital part of the plant holobiont. They establish plant-microbe or microbe-microbe associations, forming a unique microbiota with each plant species and under different environmental conditions. These microbial communities have to adapt to diverse environmental conditions, such as geographical location, climate conditions and soil types, and are subjected to changes in their surrounding environment. Elevated ozone concentration is one of the most important aspects of global change, but its effect on microbial communities living on plant surfaces has barely been investigated. In the current study, we aimed at elucidating the potential effect of elevated ozone concentrations on the phyllosphere (aerial part of the plant) and rhizoplane (surface of the root) microbiota by adopting next-generation 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. A standard japonica rice cultivar Nipponbare and an ozone-tolerant breeding line L81 (Nipponbare background) were pre-grown in a greenhouse for 10 weeks and then exposed to ozone at 85 ppb for 7 h daily for 30 days in open top chambers. Microbial cells were collected from the phyllosphere and rhizoplane separately. The treatment or different genotypes did not affect various diversity indices. On the other hand, the relative abundance of some bacterial taxa were significantly affected in the rhizoplane community of ozone-treated plants. A significant effect of ozone was detected by homogeneity of molecular variance analysis in the phyllosphere, meaning that the community from ozone-treated phyllosphere samples was more variable than those from control plants. In addition, a weak treatment effect was observed by clustering samples based on the Yue and Clayton and weighted UniFrac distance matrices among samples. We therefore conclude that the elevated ozone concentrations affected the bacterial community structure of the phyllosphere and the rhizosplane as a whole, even though this effect was rather weak and did not lead to changes of the function of the communities.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis",Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
74,2016,Marine and giant viruses as indicators of a marine microbial community in a riverine system,"Viral communities are important for ecosystem function as they are involved in critical biogeochemical cycles and controlling host abundance. This study investigates riverine viral communities around a small rural town that influences local water inputs. Myoviridae, Siphoviridae, Phycodnaviridae, Mimiviridae, Herpesviridae, and Podoviridae were the most abundant families. Viral species upstream and downstream of the town were similar, with Synechoccocus phage, salinus, Prochlorococcus phage, Mimivirus A, and Human herpes 6A virus most abundant, contributing to 4.9–38.2% of average abundance within the metagenomic profiles, with Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus present in metagenomes as the expected hosts for the phage. Overall, the majority of abundant viral species were or were most similar to those of marine origin. At over 60 km to the river mouth, the presence of marine communities provides some support for the Baas‐Becking hypothesis “everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects.” We conclude marine microbial species may occur more frequently in freshwater systems than previously assumed, and hence may play important roles in some freshwater ecosystems within tens to a hundred kilometers from the sea.","Virus, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
75,2016,Antimicrobial peptides trigger a division block in Escherichia coli through stimulation of a signalling system,"Antimicrobial peptides are an important component of the molecular arsenal employed by hosts against bacteria. Many bacteria in turn possess pathways that provide protection against these compounds. In Escherichia coli and related bacteria, the PhoQ/PhoP signalling system is a key regulator of this antimicrobial peptide defence. Here we show that treating E. coli with sublethal concentrations of antimicrobial peptides causes cells to filament, and that this division block is controlled by the PhoQ/PhoP system. The filamentation results from increased expression of QueE, an enzyme that is part of a tRNA modification pathway but that, as we show here, also affects cell division. We also find that a functional YFP–QueE fusion localizes to the division septum in filamentous cells, suggesting QueE blocks septation through interaction with the divisome. Regulation of septation by PhoQ/PhoP may protect cells from antimicrobial peptide-induced stress or other conditions associated with high-level stimulation of this signalling system. The PhoQ/PhoP system regulates antimicrobial peptide defense in bacteria. Here the authors show that at sublethal concentrations of antimicrobial peptides, PhoPQ induces QueE, that then localizes to the divisome and blocks cell division independently of its function in queuosine biosynthesis.",Bacteria,"Functional analysis, Interactome, AMR",,Health & Disease
76,2016,Composition and function of the pediatric colonic mucosal microbiome in untreated patients with ulcerative colitis,"ABSTRACT Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic intestinal inflammatory disorders characterized by a complex disruption of the physiologic interaction between the host immune system and intestinal microbes precipitated by environmental factors. Numerous observations indicate the altered composition and function of the intestinal microbiome of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), a subtype of IBD. The accuracy of these results may be limited by confounding factors, such as concurrent medication use. To address these limitations, we examined the colonic mucosal microbiome of pediatric patients with UC prior to initiating treatment. Based on bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we identified a significant decrease in the phylum Verrucomicrobia in patients with UC. At the genus level, we observed a significant decrease in the short chain fatty acid producer Roseburia. Despite these compositional changes, we did not identify inferred gene content differences between the UC and control groups. To determine if microbial taxa may be associated with clinical outcomes, we retrospectively assessed the clinical course of the UC patients. Despite similar metrics of OTU richness and diversity, multiple OTU differences were observed between patients who responded to therapy and those who did not. Our observations regarding the mucosal microbiome and the associations with differential clinical outcomes support the contributions of gut microbes to disease onset and modulation.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome",Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

However, the sensitivity of plot-scale experiments simulating climate change effects on Arctic heathland soils to potential confounding effects of spatial and temporal changes in soil microbial communities is unknown. Here, the variation in heathland soil bacterial communities at two survey sites in Sweden between spring and summer 2013 and at scales between 0-1 m and, 1-100 m and between sites (> 100 m) were investigated in parallel using 16S rRNA gene T-RFLP and amplicon sequencing. T-RFLP did not reveal spatial structuring of communities at scales < 100 m in any site or season. However, temporal changes were striking. Amplicon sequencing corroborated shifts from r- to K-selected taxon-dominated communities, influencing in silico predictions of functional potential. Network analyses reveal temporal keystone taxa, with a spring betaproteobacterial sub-network centred upon a Burkholderia operational taxonomic unit (OTU) and a reconfiguration to a summer sub-network centred upon an alphaproteobacterial OTU. Although spatial structuring effects may not confound comparison between plot-scale treatments, temporal change is a significant influence. Moreover, the prominence of two temporally exclusive keystone taxa suggests that the stability of Arctic heathland soil bacterial communities could be disproportionally influenced by seasonal perturbations affecting individual taxa.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis",Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
79,2016,Microbial co-occurrence patterns in deep Precambrian bedrock fracture fluids,"Abstract. The bacterial and archaeal community composition and the possible carbon assimilation processes and energy sources of microbial communities in oligotrophic, deep, crystalline bedrock fractures is yet to be resolved. In this study, intrinsic microbial communities from groundwater of six fracture zones from 180 to 2300 m depths in Outokumpu bedrock were characterized using high-throughput amplicon sequencing and metagenomic prediction. Comamonadaceae-, Anaerobrancaceae- and Pseudomonadaceae-related operational taxonomic units (OTUs) form the core community in deep crystalline bedrock fractures in Outokumpu. Archaeal communities were mainly composed of Methanobacteriaceae-affiliating OTUs. The predicted bacterial metagenomes showed that pathways involved in fatty acid and amino sugar metabolism were common. In addition, relative abundance of genes coding the enzymes of autotrophic carbon fixation pathways in predicted metagenomes was low. This indicates that heterotrophic carbon assimilation is more important for microbial communities of the fracture zones. Network analysis based on co-occurrence of OTUs revealed possible “keystone” genera of the microbial communities belonging to Burkholderiales and Clostridiales. Bacterial communities in fractures resemble those found in oligotrophic, hydrogen-enriched environments. Serpentinization reactions of ophiolitic rocks in Outokumpu assemblage may provide a source of energy and organic carbon compounds for the microbial communities in the fractures. Sulfate reducers and methanogens form a minority of the total microbial communities, but OTUs forming these minor groups are similar to those found in other deep Precambrian terrestrial bedrock environments.","Bacteria, Archaea, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,"Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

82,2016,Exploration of Human Salivary Microbiomes—Insights into the Novel Characteristics of Microbial Community Structure in Caries and Caries-Free Subjects,"Recently, high-throughput sequencing has improved the understanding of the microbiological etiology of caries, but the characteristics of the microbial community structure in the human oral cavity with and without caries are not completely clear. To better understand these characteristics, Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing was utilized to analyze 20 salivary samples (10 caries-free and 10 caries) from subjects from the same town in Dongxiang, Gansu, China. A total of 5,113 OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units, 97% cutoff) were characterized in all of the salivary samples obtained from the 20 subjects. A comparison of the two groups revealed that (i) the predominant phyla were constant between the two groups; (ii) the relative abundance of the genera Veillonella, Bifidobacterium, Selenomonas, Olsenella, Parascardovia, Scardovia, Chryseobacterium, Terrimonas, Burkholderia and Sporobacter was significantly higher in the group with caries (P < 0.05); and (iii) four genera with low relative abundance (< 0.01% on average), including two characteristic genera in caries (Chryseobacterium and Scardovia), significantly influenced the microbial community structure at the genus and OTU levels. Moreover, via co-occurrence and principal component analyses, the co-prevalence of the pathogenic genera was detected in the caries samples, but in the caries-free samples, the function of clustered genera was more random. This result suggests that a synergistic effect may be influencing the assembly of the caries microbial community, whereas competition may play a more dominant role in governing the microbial community in the caries-free group. Our findings regarding the characteristics of the microbial communities of the groups with and without caries might improve the understanding of the microbiological etiology of caries and might improve the prevention and cure of caries in the future.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, MAGs",,Health & Disease

Decrease in RNA expression ratios of human to bacteria and viruses accompanying deteriorated conditions was evident in both studies. Despite large between-subject variations in bacterial composition before LVAD implantation among all the patients, on day 180 after the implantation they manifested apparent between-subject bacterial similarity. In the iPOP study three periods, namely, pre-respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection with normal blood glucose level, RSV infection with normal blood glucose level and post-RSV infection with high blood glucose level could be defined. The upsurge of Enterobacteria phage PhiX 174 sensu lato and Escherichia coli gene expression, in which membrane transporters, membrane receptors for environment signalling, carbohydrate catabolic genes and carbohydrate-active enzymes were enriched only throughout the second period, which suggests a potentially overlooked microbial response to or modulation of the host blood glucose level.","Bacteria, Virus",,,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
84,2015,Methanosarcina Play an Important Role in Anaerobic Co-Digestion of the Seaweed Ulva lactuca: Taxonomy and Predicted Metabolism of Functional Microbial Communities,"Macro-algae represent an ideal resource of third generation biofuels, but their use necessitates a refinement of commonly used anaerobic digestion processes. In a previous study, contrasting mixes of dairy slurry and the macro-alga Ulva lactuca were anaerobically digested in mesophilic continuously stirred tank reactors for 40 weeks. Higher proportions of U. lactuca in the feedstock led to inhibited digestion and rapid accumulation of volatile fatty acids, requiring a reduced organic loading rate. In this study, 16S pyrosequencing was employed to characterise the microbial communities of both the weakest (R1) and strongest (R6) performing reactors from the previous work as they developed over a 39 and 27-week period respectively. Comparing the reactor communities revealed clear differences in taxonomy, predicted metabolic orientation and mechanisms of inhibition, while constrained canonical analysis (CCA) showed ammonia and biogas yield to be the strongest factors differentiating the two reactor communities. Significant biomarker taxa and predicted metabolic activities were identified for viable and failing anaerobic digestion of U. lactuca. Acetoclastic methanogens were inhibited early in R1 operation, followed by a gradual decline of hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Near-total loss of methanogens led to an accumulation of acetic acid that reduced performance of R1, while a slow decline in biogas yield in R6 could be attributed to inhibition of acetogenic rather than methanogenic activity. The improved performance of R6 is likely to have been as a result of the large Methanosarcina population, which enabled rapid removal of acetic acid, providing favourable conditions for substrate degradation.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Gene identification / Biomarker",Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

87,2015,"Microbial Communities Can Be Described by Metabolic Structure: A General Framework and Application to a Seasonally Variable, Depth-Stratified Microbial Community from the Coastal West Antarctic Peninsula","Taxonomic marker gene studies, such as the 16S rRNA gene, have been used to successfully explore microbial diversity in a variety of marine, terrestrial, and host environments. For some of these environments long term sampling programs are beginning to build a historical record of microbial community structure. Although these 16S rRNA gene datasets do not intrinsically provide information on microbial metabolism or ecosystem function, this information can be developed by identifying metabolisms associated with related, phenotyped strains. Here we introduce the concept of metabolic inference; the systematic prediction of metabolism from phylogeny, and describe a complete pipeline for predicting the metabolic pathways likely to be found in a collection of 16S rRNA gene phylotypes. This framework includes a mechanism for assigning confidence to each metabolic inference that is based on a novel method for evaluating genomic plasticity. We applied this framework to 16S rRNA gene libraries from the West Antarctic Peninsula marine environment, including surface and deep summer samples and surface winter samples. Using statistical methods commonly applied to community ecology data we found that metabolic structure differed between summer surface and winter and deep samples, comparable to an analysis of community structure by 16S rRNA gene phylotypes. While taxonomic variance between samples was primarily driven by low abundance taxa, metabolic variance was attributable to both high and low abundance pathways. This suggests that clades with a high degree of functional redundancy can occupy distinct adjacent niches. Overall our findings demonstrate that inferred metabolism can be used in place of taxonomy to describe the structure of microbial communities. Coupling metabolic inference with targeted metagenomics and an improved collection of completed genomes could be a powerful way to analyze microbial communities in a high-throughput manner that provides direct access to metabolic and ecosystem function.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

89,2015,A Comparison between Transcriptome Sequencing and 16S Metagenomics for Detection of Bacterial Pathogens in Wildlife,"Background Rodents are major reservoirs of pathogens responsible for numerous zoonotic diseases in humans and livestock. Assessing their microbial diversity at both the individual and population level is crucial for monitoring endemic infections and revealing microbial association patterns within reservoirs. Recently, NGS approaches have been employed to characterize microbial communities of different ecosystems. Yet, their relative efficacy has not been assessed. Here, we compared two NGS approaches, RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) and 16S-metagenomics, assessing their ability to survey neglected zoonotic bacteria in rodent populations. Methodology/Principal Findings We first extracted nucleic acids from the spleens of 190 voles collected in France. RNA extracts were pooled, randomly retro-transcribed, then RNA-Seq was performed using HiSeq. Assembled bacterial sequences were assigned to the closest taxon registered in GenBank. DNA extracts were analyzed via a 16S-metagenomics approach using two sequencers: the 454 GS-FLX and the MiSeq. The V4 region of the gene coding for 16S rRNA was amplified for each sample using barcoded universal primers. Amplicons were multiplexed and processed on the distinct sequencers. The resulting datasets were de-multiplexed, and each read was processed through a pipeline to be taxonomically classified using the Ribosomal Database Project. Altogether, 45 pathogenic bacterial genera were detected. The bacteria identified by RNA-Seq were comparable to those detected by 16S-metagenomics approach processed with MiSeq (16S-MiSeq). In contrast, 21 of these pathogens went unnoticed when the 16S-metagenomics approach was processed via 454-pyrosequencing (16S-454). In addition, the 16S-metagenomics approaches revealed a high level of coinfection in bank voles. Conclusions/Significance We concluded that RNA-Seq and 16S-MiSeq are equally sensitive in detecting bacteria. Although only the 16S-MiSeq method enabled identification of bacteria in each individual reservoir, with subsequent derivation of bacterial prevalence in host populations, and generation of intra-reservoir patterns of bacterial interactions. Lastly, the number of bacterial reads obtained with the 16S-MiSeq could be a good proxy for bacterial prevalence.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Interactome","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics, (Meta)transcriptomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

If the investigation is aimed only at the microbiome taxonomic structure, a target-based metagenomic approach, here also referred as Meta-barcoding, is generally applied. This approach commonly involves the selective amplification of a species-specific genetic marker (DNA meta-barcode) in the whole taxonomic range of interest and the exploration of its taxon-related variants through High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) technologies. The accessibility to proper computational systems for the large-scale bioinformatic analysis of HTS data represents, currently, one of the major challenges in advanced Meta-barcoding projects. BioMaS (Bioinformatic analysis of Metagenomic AmpliconS) is a new bioinformatic pipeline designed to support biomolecular researchers involved in taxonomic studies of environmental microbial communities by a completely automated workflow, comprehensive of all the fundamental steps, from raw sequence data upload and cleaning to final taxonomic identification, that are absolutely required in an appropriately designed Meta-barcoding HTS-based experiment. In its current version, BioMaS allows the analysis of both bacterial and fungal environments starting directly from the raw sequencing data from either Roche 454 or Illumina HTS platforms, following two alternative paths, respectively. BioMaS is implemented into a public web service available at https://recasgateway.ba.infn.it/ and is also available in Galaxy at http://galaxy.cloud.ba.infn.it:8080 (only for Illumina data). BioMaS is a friendly pipeline for Meta-barcoding HTS data analysis specifically designed for users without particular computing skills. A comparative benchmark, carried out by using a simulated dataset suitably designed to broadly represent the currently known bacterial and fungal world, showed that BioMaS outperforms QIIME and MOTHUR in terms of extent and accuracy of deep taxonomic sequence assignments.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Variant, Comparative analysis","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

The aim of this study was to evaluate the fecal microbiome, fecal concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), as well as serum and urine metabolites in healthy dogs (n=13) and dogs with acute diarrhea (n=13). The fecal microbiome, SCFAs, and serum/urine metabolite profiles were characterized by 454-pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA genes, GC/MS, and untargeted and targeted metabolomics approach using UPLC/MS and HPLC/MS, respectively. Significantly lower bacterial diversity was observed in dogs with acute diarrhea in regards to species richness, chao1, and Shannon index (p=0.0218, 0.0176, and 0.0033; respectively). Dogs with acute diarrhea had significantly different microbial communities compared to healthy dogs (unweighted Unifrac distances, ANOSIM p=0.0040). While Bacteroidetes, Faecalibacterium, and an unclassified genus within Ruminococcaceae were underrepresented, the genus Clostridium was overrepresented in dogs with acute diarrhea. Concentrations of fecal propionic acid were significantly decreased in acute diarrhea (p=0.0033), and were correlated to a decrease in Faecalibacterium (ρ=0.6725, p=0.0332). The predicted functional gene content of the microbiome (PICRUSt) revealed overrepresentations of genes for transposase enzymes as well as methyl accepting chemotaxis proteins in acute diarrhea. Serum concentrations of kynurenic acid and urine concentrations of 2-methyl-1H-indole and 5-Methoxy-1H-indole-3-carbaldehyde were significantly decreased in acute diarrhea (p=0.0048, 0.0185, and 0.0330, respectively).

Based on these results, we then conducted similar microcosm experiments to examine microbial mobility within natural soil bacterial communities under a single nutrient regime. The expansion of bacterial populations within the community was assayed by quantitative PCR and pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments. We observed that only a relatively small subset of the total community was able to expand to an appreciable distance (more than 2 cm) within 48 h, with the genera Undibacterium, Pseudomonas and Massilia and especially the family Enterobacteriaceae dominating the communities more distant from the point of inoculation. These results suggest that (re-)colonization of open habitats in soil may be dominated by a few rapidly moving species, which may have important consequences for microbial succession.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
97,2015,Phage-bacteria network analysis and its implication for the understanding of coral disease.,"Multiple studies have explored microbial shifts in diseased or stressed corals; however, little is known about bacteriophage interactions with microbes in this context. This study characterized microbial 16S rRNA amplicons and phage metagenomes associated with Montastraea annularis corals during a concurrent white plague disease outbreak and bleaching event. Phage consortia differed between bleached and diseased tissues. Phages in the family Inoviridae were elevated in diseased or healthy tissues compared with bleached portions of diseased tissues. Microbial communities also differed between diseased and bleached corals. Bacteria in the orders Rhodobacterales and Campylobacterales were increased while Kiloniellales was decreased in diseased compared with other tissues. A network of phage-bacteria interactions was constructed of all phage strains and 11 bacterial genera that differed across health states. Phage-bacteria interactions varied in specificity: phages interacted with one to eight bacterial hosts while bacteria interacted with up to 59 phages. Six phages were identified that interacted exclusively with Rhodobacterales and Campylobacterales. These results suggest that phages have a role in controlling stress-associated bacteria, and that networks can be utilized to select potential phages for mitigating detrimental bacterial growth in phage therapy applications.","Bacteria, Virus, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Interactome","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Health & Disease
98,2015,Influence of a Non-Hospital Medical Care Facility on Antimicrobial Resistance in Wastewater,"The global widespread use of antimicrobials and accompanying increase in resistant bacterial strains is of major public health concern. Wastewater systems and wastewater treatment plants are considered a niche for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), with diverse microbial communities facilitating ARG transfer via mobile genetic element (MGE). In contrast to hospital sewage, wastewater from other health care facilities is still poorly investigated. At the instance of a nursing home located in south-west Germany, in the present study, shotgun metagenomics was used to investigate the impact on wastewater of samples collected up- and down-stream in different seasons. Microbial composition, ARGs and MGEs were analyzed using different annotation approaches with various databases, including Antibiotic Resistance Ontologies (ARO), integrons and plasmids. Our analysis identified seasonal differences in microbial communities and abundance of ARG and MGE between samples from different seasons. However, no obvious differences were detected between up- and downstream samples. The results suggest that, in contrast to hospitals, sewage from the nursing home does not have a major impact on ARG or MGE in wastewater, presumably due to much less intense antimicrobial usage. Possible limitations of metagenomic studies using high-throughput sequencing for detection of genes that seemingly confer antibiotic resistance are discussed.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR, Annotation","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

We developed a new method called CoVennTree (Comparative weighted Venn Tree) that simultaneously compares up to three multifarious datasets by aggregating and propagating information from the bottom to the top level and produces a graphical output in Cytoscape. With the introduction of weighted Venn structures, the contents and relationships of various datasets can be correlated and simultaneously aggregated without losing information. We demonstrate the suitability of this approach using a dataset of 16S rDNA sequences obtained from microbial populations at three different depths of the Gulf of Aqaba in the Red Sea.

102,2015,Seasonal community succession of the phyllosphere microbiome.,"The leaf microbiome is influenced by both biotic and abiotic factors. Currently, we know little about the relative importance of these factors in determining microbiota composition and dynamics. To explore this issue, we collected weekly leaf samples over a 98-day growing season from multiple cultivars of common bean, soybean, and canola planted at three locations in Ontario, Canada, and performed Illumina-based microbiome analysis. We find that the leaf microbiota at the beginning of the season is very strongly influenced by the soil microbiota but, as the season progresses, it differentiates, becomes significantly less diverse, and transitions to having a greater proportion of leaf-specific taxa that are shared among all samples. A phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states imputation of microbiome function inferred from the taxonomic data found significant differences between the soil and leaf microbiome, with a significant enrichment of motility gene categories in the former and metabolic gene categories in the latter. A network co-occurrence analysis identified two highly connected clusters as well as subclusters of putative pathogens and growth-promoting bacteria. These data reveal some of the complex ecological dynamics that occur in microbial communities over the course of a growing season and highlight the importance of community succession.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis",,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
103,2015,Metagenomics: Tools and Insights for Analyzing Next-Generation Sequencing Data Derived from Biodiversity Studies,"Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have allowed significant breakthroughs in microbial ecology studies. This has led to the rapid expansion of research in the field and the establishment of “metagenomics”, often defined as the analysis of DNA from microbial communities in environmental samples without prior need for culturing. Many metagenomics statistical/computational tools and databases have been developed in order to allow the exploitation of the huge influx of data. In this review article, we provide an overview of the sequencing technologies and how they are uniquely suited to various types of metagenomic studies. We focus on the currently available bioinformatics techniques, tools, and methodologies for performing each individual step of a typical metagenomic dataset analysis. We also provide future trends in the field with respect to tools and technologies currently under development. Moreover, we discuss data management, distribution, and integration tools that are capable of performing comparative metagenomic analyses of multiple datasets using well-established databases, as well as commonly used annotation standards.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, Annotation, Comparative analysis","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
104,2014,Impact of analytic provenance in genome analysis,"Many computational methods are available for assembly and annotation of newly sequenced microbial genomes. However, when new genomes are reported in the literature, there is frequently very little critical analysis of choices made during the sequence assembly and gene annotation stages. These choices have a direct impact on the biologically relevant products of a genomic analysis - for instance identification of common and differentiating regions among genomes in a comparison, or identification of enriched gene functional categories in a specific strain. Here, we examine the outcomes of different assembly and analysis steps in typical workflows in a comparison among strains of Vibrio vulnificus. Using six recently sequenced strains of V. vulnificus, we demonstrate the ""alternate realities"" of comparative genomics, and how they depend on the choice of a robust assembly method and accurate ab initio annotation. We apply several popular assemblers for paired-end Illumina data, and three well-regarded ab initio genefinders. We demonstrate significant differences in detected gene overlap among comparative genomics workflows that depend on these two steps. The divergence between workflows, even those using widely adopted methods, is obvious both at the single genome level and when a comparison is performed. In a typical example where multiple workflows are applied to the strain V. vulnificus CECT 4606, a workflow that uses the Velvet assembler and Glimmer gene finder identifies 3275 gene features, while a workflow that uses the Velvet assembler and the RAST annotation system identifies 5011 gene features. Only 3171 genes are identical between both workflows. When we examine 9 assembly/ annotation workflow scenarios as input to a three-way genome comparison, differentiating genes and even differentially represented functional categories change significantly from scenario to scenario. Inconsistencies in genomic analysis can arise depending on the choices that are made during the assembly and annotation stages. These inconsistencies can have a significant impact on the interpretation of an individual genome's content. The impact is multiplied when comparison of content and function among multiple genomes is the goal. Tracking the analysis history of the data - its analytic provenance - is critical for reproducible analysis of genome data.",,"Functional analysis, MAGs, Annotation, Comparative analysis",(Meta)genomics,
105,2014,"Small RNAs from plants, bacteria and fungi within the order Hypocreales are ubiquitous in human plasma","The human microbiome plays a significant role in maintaining normal physiology. Changes in its composition have been associated with bowel disease, metabolic disorders and atherosclerosis. Sequences of microbial origin have been observed within small RNA sequencing data obtained from blood samples. The aim of this study was to characterise the microbiome from which these sequences are derived. Abundant non-human small RNA sequences were identified in plasma and plasma exosomal samples. Assembly of these short sequences into longer contigs was the pivotal novel step in ascertaining their origin by BLAST searches. Most reads mapped to rRNA sequences. The taxonomic profiles of the microbes detected were very consistent between individuals but distinct from microbiomes reported at other sites. The majority of bacterial reads were from the phylum Proteobacteria, whilst for 5 of 6 individuals over 90% of the more abundant fungal reads were from the phylum Ascomycota; of these over 90% were from the order Hypocreales. Many contigs were from plants, presumably of dietary origin. In addition, extremely abundant small RNAs derived from human Y RNAs were detected. A characteristic profile of a subset of the human microbiome can be obtained by sequencing small RNAs present in the blood. The source and functions of these molecules remain to be determined, but the specific profiles are likely to reflect health status. The potential to provide biomarkers of diet and for the diagnosis and prognosis of human disease is immense.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, MAGs, Gene identification / Biomarker",,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
106,2014,The Functional Potential of Microbial Communities in Hydraulic Fracturing Source Water and Produced Water from Natural Gas Extraction Characterized by Metagenomic Sequencing,"Microbial activity in produced water from hydraulic fracturing operations can lead to undesired environmental impacts and increase gas production costs. However, the metabolic profile of these microbial communities is not well understood. Here, for the first time, we present results from a shotgun metagenome of microbial communities in both hydraulic fracturing source water and wastewater produced by hydraulic fracturing. Taxonomic analyses showed an increase in anaerobic/facultative anaerobic classes related to Clostridia, Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidia and Epsilonproteobacteria in produced water as compared to predominantly aerobic Alphaproteobacteria in the fracturing source water. The metabolic profile revealed a relative increase in genes responsible for carbohydrate metabolism, respiration, sporulation and dormancy, iron acquisition and metabolism, stress response and sulfur metabolism in the produced water samples. These results suggest that microbial communities in produced water have an increased genetic ability to handle stress, which has significant implications for produced water management, such as disinfection.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

108,2014,Should We Build “Obese” or “Lean” Anaerobic Digesters?,"Conventional anaerobic digesters (ADs) treating dairy manure are fed with raw or fermented manure rich in volatile fatty acids (VFAs). In contrast, pre-fermented AD (PF-AD) is fed with the more recalcitrant, fiber-rich fraction of manure that has been pre-fermented and depleted of VFAs. Thus, the substrate of PF-AD may be likened to a lean diet rich in fibers while the pre-fermentation stage fermenter is fed a relatively rich diet containing labile organic substances. Previous results have shown that conventional and pre-fermented ADs fed with raw or pre-fermented manure, respectively, produced comparable methane yields. The primary objective of this study was to characterize, using next-generation DNA sequencing, the bacterial communities in various bioreactors (pre-fermentation stage fermenter; various operational arrangements PF-AD; conventional single-stage AD; and a full scale AD) and compare the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratios in these different systems. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes constituted the two most abundant phyla in all AD samples analyzed, as well as most of the samples analyzed in the fermenters and manure samples. Higher relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, ranging from 26% to 51% of bacteria, tended to be associated with PF-AD samples, while the highest relative abundance of Firmicutes occurred in the fermenter (maximum of 76% of bacteria) and manure (maximum of 66% of bacteria) samples. On average, primary stage fermenters exhibited microbiological traits linked to obesity: higher F/B ratios and a ‘diet’ that is less fibrous and more labile compared to that fed to PF-AD. On the other hand, microbial characteristics associated with leanness (lower F/B ratios combined with fibrous substrate) were associated with PF-AD. We propose that bacterial communities in AD shift depending on the quality of substrate, which ultimately results in maintaining VFA yields in PF-AD, similar to the role of bacterial communities and a high fiber diet in lean mice.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
109,2014,The unseen world: environmental microbial sequencing and identification methods for ecologists,"Microorganisms inhabit almost every environment, comprise the majority of diversity on Earth, are important in biogeochemical cycling, and may be vital to ecosystem responses to large-scale climatic change. In recent years, ecologists have begun to use rapidly advancing molecular techniques to address questions about microbial diversity, biogeography, and responses to environmental change. Studies of microbes in the environment generally focus on three broad objectives: determining which organisms are present, what their functional capabilities are, and which are active at any given time. However, comprehending the range of methodologies currently in use can be daunting. To provide an overview of environmental microbial sequence data collection and analysis approaches, we include case studies of microbiomes ranging from the human mouth to geothermal springs.

110,2014,Microbiota diversity and gene expression dynamics in human oral biofilms,"BackgroundMicro-organisms inhabiting teeth surfaces grow on biofilms where a specific and complex succession of bacteria has been described by co-aggregation tests and DNA-based studies. Although the composition of oral biofilms is well established, the active portion of the bacterial community and the patterns of gene expression in vivo have not been studied.ResultsUsing RNA-sequencing technologies, we present the first metatranscriptomic study of human dental plaque, performed by two different approaches: (1) A short-reads, high-coverage approach by Illumina sequencing to characterize the gene activity repertoire of the microbial community during biofilm development; (2) A long-reads, lower-coverage approach by pyrosequencing to determine the taxonomic identity of the active microbiome before and after a meal ingestion. The high-coverage approach allowed us to analyze over 398 million reads, revealing that microbial communities are individual-specific and no bacterial species was detected as key player at any time during biofilm formation. We could identify some gene expression patterns characteristic for early and mature oral biofilms. The transcriptomic profile of several adhesion genes was confirmed through qPCR by measuring expression of fimbriae-associated genes. In addition to the specific set of gene functions overexpressed in early and mature oral biofilms, as detected through the short-reads dataset, the long-reads approach detected specific changes when comparing the metatranscriptome of the same individual before and after a meal, which can narrow down the list of organisms responsible for acid production and therefore potentially involved in dental caries.ConclusionsThe bacteria changing activity during biofilm formation and after meal ingestion were person-specific. Interestingly, some individuals showed extreme homeostasis with virtually no changes in the active bacterial population after food ingestion, suggesting the presence of a microbial community which could be associated to dental health.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis","(Meta)transcriptomics, Metatranscriptomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
111,2014,Bioinformatic Approaches Reveal Metagenomic Characterization of Soil Microbial Community,"As is well known, soil is a complex ecosystem harboring the most prokaryotic biodiversity on the Earth. In recent years, the advent of high-throughput sequencing techniques has greatly facilitated the progress of soil ecological studies. However, how to effectively understand the underlying biological features of large-scale sequencing data is a new challenge. In the present study, we used 33 publicly available metagenomes from diverse soil sites (i.e. grassland, forest soil, desert, Arctic soil, and mangrove sediment) and integrated some state-of-the-art computational tools to explore the phylogenetic and functional characterizations of the microbial communities in soil. Microbial composition and metabolic potential in soils were comprehensively illustrated at the metagenomic level. A spectrum of metagenomic biomarkers containing 46 taxa and 33 metabolic modules were detected to be significantly differential that could be used as indicators to distinguish at least one of five soil communities. The co-occurrence associations between complex microbial compositions and functions were inferred by network-based approaches. Our results together with the established bioinformatic pipelines should provide a foundation for future research into the relation between soil biodiversity and ecosystem function.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Gene identification / Biomarker","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
112,2014,The marriage of nutrigenomics with the microbiome: the case of infant-associated bifidobacteria and milk.,"Broadly, nutrigenomics examines the association of exogenous nutrients and molecular responses to maintain homeostasis in an individual. Phenotypic expression profiling, often transcriptomics, has been applied to identify markers and metabolic consequences of suboptimal diet, lifestyle, or both. The decade after the Human Genome Project has been marked with advances in high-throughput analysis of biological polymers and metabolites, prompting a rapid increase in characterization of the profound nature by which our symbiotic microbiota influences human physiology. Although the technology is widely accessible to assess microbiome composition, genetic potential, and global function, nutrigenomics studies often exclude the microbial contribution to host responses to ingested nutritive molecules. Perhaps a hallmark of coevolution, milk provides a dramatic example of a diet that promotes a particular microbial community structure, because the lower infant gastrointestinal tract is often dominated by bifidobacteria that flourish on milk glycans. Systems-level approaches should continue to be applied to examine the microbial communities in the context of their host's dietary habits and metabolic status. In addition, studies of isolated microbiota species should be encouraged to inform clinical studies and interventions as well as community studies. Whereas nutrigenomics research is beginning to account for resident microbiota, the need remains to consistently consider our microscopic partners in the human holobiont.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis","(Meta)genomics, (Meta)transcriptomics, Metabolomics",Health & Disease
113,2013,Discovery of Microorganisms and Enzymes Involved in High-Solids Decomposition of Rice Straw Using Metagenomic Analyses,"High-solids incubations were performed to enrich for microbial communities and enzymes that decompose rice straw under mesophilic (35°C) and thermophilic (55°C) conditions. Thermophilic enrichments yielded a community that was 7.5 times more metabolically active on rice straw than mesophilic enrichments. Extracted xylanase and endoglucanse activities were also 2.6 and 13.4 times greater, respectively, for thermophilic enrichments. Metagenome sequencing was performed on enriched communities to determine community composition and mine for genes encoding lignocellulolytic enzymes. Proteobacteria were found to dominate the mesophilic community while Actinobacteria were most abundant in the thermophilic community. Analysis of protein family representation in each metagenome indicated that cellobiohydrolases containing carbohydrate binding module 2 (CBM2) were significantly overrepresented in the thermophilic community. Micromonospora, a member of Actinobacteria, primarily housed these genes in the thermophilic community. In light of these findings, Micromonospora and other closely related Actinobacteria genera appear to be promising sources of thermophilic lignocellulolytic enzymes for rice straw deconstruction under high-solids conditions. Furthermore, these discoveries warrant future research to determine if exoglucanases with CBM2 represent thermostable enzymes tolerant to the process conditions expected to be encountered during industrial biofuel production.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,"(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
114,2013,Metagenomic Profiling of Antibiotic Resistance Genes and Mobile Genetic Elements in a Tannery Wastewater Treatment Plant,"Antibiotics are often used to prevent sickness and improve production in animal agriculture, and the residues in animal bodies may enter tannery wastewater during leather production. This study aimed to use Illumina high-throughput sequencing to investigate the occurrence, diversity and abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in aerobic and anaerobic sludge of a full-scale tannery wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Metagenomic analysis showed that Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria dominated in the WWTP, but the relative abundance of archaea in anaerobic sludge was higher than in aerobic sludge. Sequencing reads from aerobic and anaerobic sludge revealed differences in the abundance of functional genes between both microbial communities. Genes coding for antibiotic resistance were identified in both communities. BLAST analysis against Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database (ARDB) further revealed that aerobic and anaerobic sludge contained various ARGs with high abundance, among which sulfonamide resistance gene sul1 had the highest abundance, occupying over 20% of the total ARGs reads. Tetracycline resistance genes (tet) were highly rich in the anaerobic sludge, among which tet33 had the highest abundance, but was absent in aerobic sludge. Over 70 types of insertion sequences were detected in each sludge sample, and class 1 integrase genes were prevalent in the WWTP. The results highlighted prevalence of ARGs and MGEs in tannery WWTPs, which may deserve more public health concerns.","Bacteria, Archaea, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, AMR","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
115,2013,Coupled high-throughput functional screening and next generation sequencing for identification of plant polymer decomposing enzymes in metagenomic libraries,"Recent advances in sequencing technologies generate new predictions and hypotheses about the functional roles of environmental microorganisms. Yet, until we can test these predictions at a scale that matches our ability to generate them, most of them will remain as hypotheses. Function-based mining of metagenomic libraries can provide direct linkages between genes, metabolic traits and microbial taxa and thus bridge this gap between sequence data generation and functional predictions. Here we developed high-throughput screening assays for function-based characterization of activities involved in plant polymer decomposition from environmental metagenomic libraries. The multiplexed assays use fluorogenic and chromogenic substrates, combine automated liquid handling and use a genetically modified expression host to enable simultaneous screening of 12,160 clones for 14 activities in a total of 170,240 reactions. Using this platform we identified 374 (0.26%) cellulose, hemicellulose, chitin, starch, phosphate and protein hydrolyzing clones from fosmid libraries prepared from decomposing leaf litter. Sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform, followed by assembly and gene prediction of a subset of 95 fosmid clones, identified a broad range of bacterial phyla, including Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, multiple Proteobacteria sub-phyla in addition to some Fungi. Carbohydrate-active enzyme genes from 20 different glycoside hydrolase (GH) families were detected. Using tetranucleotide frequency (TNF) binning of fosmid sequences, multiple enzyme activities from distinct fosmids were linked, demonstrating how biochemically-confirmed functional traits in environmental metagenomes may be attributed to groups of specific organisms. Overall, our results demonstrate how functional screening of metagenomic libraries can be used to connect microbial functionality to community composition and, as a result, complement large-scale metagenomic sequencing efforts.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, MAGs","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
116,2013,Culture-Independence for Surveillance and Epidemiology,"Culture-independent methods in microbiology (quantitative PCR (qPCR), sequencing, microarrays, direct from sample matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF MS), etc.) are disruptive technology. Rather than providing the same results as culture-based methods more quickly, more cheaply or with improved accuracy, they reveal an unexpected diversity of microbes and illuminate dark corners of undiagnosed disease. At times, they overturn existing definitions of presumably well-understood infections, generating new requirements for clinical diagnosis, surveillance and epidemiology. However, current diagnostic microbiology, infection control and epidemiology rest principally on culture methods elegantly optimized by clinical laboratorians. The clinical significance is interwoven; the new methods are out of context, difficult to interpret and impossible to act upon. Culture-independent diagnostics and surveillance methods will not be deployed unless the reported results can be used to select specific therapeutics or infection control measures. To cut the knots surrounding the adoption of culture-independent methods in medical microbiology, culture-dependent methods should be supported by consistent culture-independent methods providing the microbial context.

The sea fan coral, Gorgonia ventalina, is a tractable study system to investigate mechanisms of immunity to a naturally occurring pathogen. Functional studies in Gorgonia ventalina immunity indicate that several key pathways and cellular components are involved in response to natural microbial invaders, although to date the functional and regulatory pathways remain largely un-described. This study used short-read sequencing (Illumina GAIIx) to identify genes involved in the response of G. ventalina to a naturally occurring Aplanochytrium spp. parasite. De novo assembly of the G. ventalina transcriptome yielded 90,230 contigs of which 40,142 were annotated. RNA-Seq analysis revealed 210 differentially expressed genes in sea fans exposed to the Aplanochytrium parasite. Differentially expressed genes involved in immunity include pattern recognition molecules, anti-microbial peptides, and genes involved in wound repair and reactive oxygen species formation. Gene enrichment analysis indicated eight biological processes were enriched representing 36 genes, largely involved with protein translation and energy production. This is the first report using high-throughput sequencing to characterize the host response of a coral to a natural pathogen. Furthermore, we have generated the first transcriptome for a soft (octocoral or non-scleractinian) coral species. Expression analysis revealed genes important in invertebrate innate immune pathways, as well as those whose role is previously un-described in cnidarians. This resource will be valuable in characterizing G. ventalina immune response to infection and co-infection of pathogens in the context of environmental change.","Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, MAGs",(Meta)transcriptomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

Using two different approaches, we compared the viral and microbial communities in several ways: by group (patients vs. controls), entity (viruses vs. bacteria), read assembly (unassembled vs. assembled reads), and methodology (our approach vs. an existing pipeline). Differences in the viral and microbial composition, and abundance between the two groups were analyzed to identify taxa that are under- or over-represented.RESULTS:A lower diversity but more variability between the CD samples in both virome and microbiome was found, with a clear distinction between groups based on the microbiome. Only ≈5% of the differential viral biomarkers are more represented in the CD group (Synechococcus phage S CBS1 and Retroviridae family viruses), compared with 95% in the control group. Unrelated patterns of bacteria and bacteriophages were observed.CONCLUSIONS:Our use of an extensive database is critical to retrieve more viral hits than in previous approaches. Unrelated patterns of bacteria and bacteriophages may be due to uneven representation of certain viruses in databases, among other factors. Further characterization of Retroviridae viruses in the CD group could be of interest, given their links with immunodeficiency and the immune responses. To conclude, some methodological considerations underlying the analysis of the viral community composition and abundance are discussed.","Bacteria, Virus, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, MAGs, Gene identification / Biomarker","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
120,2013,Microbial Diversity Analysis of Fermented Mung Beans (Lu-Doh-Huang) by Using Pyrosequencing and Culture Methods,"In Taiwanese alternative medicine Lu-doh-huang (also called Pracparatum mungo), mung beans are mixed with various herbal medicines and undergo a 4-stage process of anaerobic fermentation. Here we used high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to profile the bacterial community structure of Lu-doh-huang samples. Pyrosequencing of samples obtained at 7 points during fermentation revealed 9 phyla, 264 genera, and 586 species of bacteria. While mung beans were inside bamboo sections (stages 1 and 2 of the fermentation process), family Lactobacillaceae and genus Lactobacillus emerged in highest abundance; Lactobacillus plantarum was broadly distributed among these samples. During stage 3, the bacterial distribution shifted to family Porphyromonadaceae, and Butyricimonas virosa became the predominant microbial component. Thereafter, bacterial counts decreased dramatically, and organisms were too few to be detected during stage 4. In addition, the microbial compositions of the liquids used for soaking bamboo sections were dramatically different: Exiguobacterium mexicanum predominated in the fermented soybean solution whereas B. virosa was predominant in running spring water. Furthermore, our results from pyrosequencing paralleled those we obtained by using the traditional culture method, which targets lactic acid bacteria. In conclusion, the microbial communities during Lu-doh-huang fermentation were markedly diverse, and pyrosequencing revealed a complete picture of the microbial consortium.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

The ease of obtaining genomic data contrasts with the relatively difficult task of translating them into insightful epidemiological information. Here, we sequenced the genomes of 90 additional invasive Canadian emm59 GAS organisms, including 80 isolated recently in 2010–2011. We used an improved bioinformatics pipeline designed to rapidly process and analyze whole-genome data and integrate strain metadata. We discovered that emm59 GAS organisms are undergoing continued multiclonal evolutionary expansion.

123,2012,Therapeutic Helminth Infection of Macaques with Idiopathic Chronic Diarrhea Alters the Inflammatory Signature and Mucosal Microbiota of the Colon,"Idiopathic chronic diarrhea (ICD) is a leading cause of morbidity amongst rhesus monkeys kept in captivity. Here, we show that exposure of affected animals to the whipworm Trichuris trichiura led to clinical improvement in fecal consistency, accompanied by weight gain, in four out of the five treated monkeys. By flow cytometry analysis of pinch biopsies collected during colonoscopies before and after treatment, we found an induction of a mucosal T(H)2 response following helminth treatment that was associated with a decrease in activated CD4(+) Ki67+ cells. In parallel, expression profiling with oligonucleotide microarrays and real-time PCR analysis revealed reductions in T(H)1-type inflammatory gene expression and increased expression of genes associated with IgE signaling, mast cell activation, eosinophil recruitment, alternative activation of macrophages, and worm expulsion. By quantifying bacterial 16S rRNA in pinch biopsies using real-time PCR analysis, we found reduced bacterial attachment to the intestinal mucosa post-treatment. Finally, deep sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA revealed changes to the composition of microbial communities attached to the intestinal mucosa following helminth treatment. Thus, the genus Streptophyta of the phylum Cyanobacteria was vastly increased in abundance in three out of five ICD monkeys relative to healthy controls, but was reduced to control levels post-treatment; by contrast, the phylum Tenericutes was expanded post-treatment. These findings suggest that helminth treatment in primates can ameliorate colitis by restoring mucosal barrier functions and reducing overall bacterial attachment, and also by altering the communities of attached bacteria. These results also define ICD in monkeys as a tractable preclinical model for ulcerative colitis in which these effects can be further investigated.","Bacteria, Virus, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis",Metabarcoding,Health & Disease

125,2012,Assessment of Metagenomic Assembly Using Simulated Next Generation Sequencing Data,"Due to the complexity of the protocols and a limited knowledge of the nature of microbial communities, simulating metagenomic sequences plays an important role in testing the performance of existing tools and data analysis methods with metagenomic data. We developed metagenomic read simulators with platform-specific (Sanger, pyrosequencing, Illumina) base-error models, and simulated metagenomes of differing community complexities. We first evaluated the effect of rigorous quality control on Illumina data. Although quality filtering removed a large proportion of the data, it greatly improved the accuracy and contig lengths of resulting assemblies. We then compared the quality-trimmed Illumina assemblies to those from Sanger and pyrosequencing. For the simple community (10 genomes) all sequencing technologies assembled a similar amount and accurately represented the expected functional composition. For the more complex community (100 genomes) Illumina produced the best assemblies and more correctly resembled the expected functional composition. For the most complex community (400 genomes) there was very little assembly of reads from any sequencing technology. However, due to the longer read length the Sanger reads still represented the overall functional composition reasonably well. We further examined the effect of scaffolding of contigs using paired-end Illumina reads. It dramatically increased contig lengths of the simple community and yielded minor improvements to the more complex communities. Although the increase in contig length was accompanied by increased chimericity, it resulted in more complete genes and a better characterization of the functional repertoire.

127,2011,Novel Degenerate PCR Method for Whole-Genome Amplification Applied to Peru Margin (ODP Leg 201) Subsurface Samples,"A degenerate polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method of whole-genome amplification, designed to work fluidly with 454 sequencing technology, was developed and tested for use on deep marine subsurface DNA samples. While optimized here for use with Roche 454 technology, the general framework presented may be applicable to other next generation sequencing systems as well (e.g., Illumina, Ion Torrent). The method, which we have called random amplification metagenomic PCR (RAMP), involves the use of specific primers from Roche 454 amplicon sequencing, modified by the addition of a degenerate region at the 3′ end. It utilizes a PCR reaction, which resulted in no amplification from blanks, even after 50 cycles of PCR. After efforts to optimize experimental conditions, the method was tested with DNA extracted from cultured E. coli cells, and genome coverage was estimated after sequencing on three different occasions. Coverage did not vary greatly with the different experimental conditions tested, and was around 62% with a sequencing effort equivalent to a theoretical genome coverage of 14.10×. The GC content of the sequenced amplification product was within 2% of the predicted values for this strain of E. coli. The method was also applied to DNA extracted from marine subsurface samples from ODP Leg 201 site 1229 (Peru Margin), and results of a taxonomic analysis revealed microbial communities dominated by Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Euryarchaeota, and Crenarchaeota, among others. These results were similar to those obtained previously for those samples; however, variations in the proportions of taxa identified illustrates well the generally accepted view that community analysis is sensitive to both the amplification technique used and the method of assigning sequences to taxonomic groups. Overall, we find that RAMP represents a valid methodology for amplifying metagenomes from low-biomass samples.","Bacteria, Archaea, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,"Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

Disease with S. aureus is complicated by dissemination of antimicrobial resistance, including methicillin resistance. Methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is a significant burden on the health care industry (HA-MRSA); however, in recent years, public health concern has arisen from isolates harbored in the community (CA-MRSA) and livestock species (LA-MRSA). Concerns with LA-MRSA isolates are the direct impact of infection with livestock isolates and indirect impacts of genetic transfer of virulence or antimicrobial resistance genes from LA-MRSA isolates. The prototypical LA-MRSA strain, sequence type (ST) 398, is considered less virulent than HAand CAMRSA isolates. Reduced virulence of LA-MRSA ST398 isolates is attributed to loss of human specific virulence factors and reduced colonization and transmission in humans. While LA-MRSA ST398 isolates are common in European swine, LA-MRSA isolates in the United States are diverse including ST398, ST9, and ST5. LA-MRSA ST5 elevated public health concerns, because, unlike MRSA ST398 and ST9, MRSA ST5 is a globally disseminated and highly pathogenic lineage. To better understand direct and indirect impact of swine associated LA-MRSA ST5, this thesis investigated the genetics of swine associated and clinical MRSA ST5 isolates. Phylogenetic analysis revealed LA-MRSA ST5 isolates are genetically distinct from clinical MRSA ST5 isolates, which was confirmed by differences in virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes harbored on mobile genetic elements.

138,2013,Elucidating mechanisms of toxicity and engineering Escherichia coli for tolerance of short chain fatty acids,"Many chemical products available today provide essential tools that make the world economy viable. However, the current reliance on fossil fuels is unsustainable and possibly negatively affects the environment. Therefore, a new method of synthesis for biorenewable and sustainable chemicals is needed. In this treatise, significant advancement in the production of short chain carboxylic acids during bacterial fermentation is described. This work offers new insights into carboxylic acid toxicity and methods for improvement of microbial tolerance that is important for improving productivity, titer, and yields for economical production of biorenewable chemicals. The methods described include metabolic engineering techniques for E. coli strain construction: gene knockouts, gene overexpression, directed evolution for tolerance and E. coli biocatalyst characterization techniques: specific growth rate, membrane fluidity, membrane leakage, membrane lipid analysis, hydrophobicity, carboxylic acid production, transcriptome analysis, intracellular pH, γ-amino butyric acid determination, proton motive force simulation, genome reverse engineering, and biocatalyst zeta potential. These methods allow greater insight into the mechanisms of toxicity of carboxylic acids and how bacteria cells improve tolerance. Hexanoic, octanoic (C8), and decanoic acids are completely inhibitory to Escherichia coli MG1655 in minimal medium. This growth inhibition is pH-dependent and is accompanied by a significant change in the fluorescence polarization (fluidity) and integrity. This inhibition and sensitivity to membrane fluidization, but not to damage of membrane integrity, can be at least partially mitigated during short-term adaptation to octanoic acid.

National AMR surveillance programs are pivotal for assessing AMR prevalence, trends, and intervention outcomes; however, integrating advanced surveillance tools can be difficult. This pilot study, conducted by FAO ECTAD Indonesia and DGLAHS, the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture, evaluated the costs and benefits of integrating the Nanopore MinION, Illumina MiSeq, and Sensititre system into a culture-based slaughterhouse–river surveillance system. Methods: Water samples were collected from six chicken slaughterhouses and adjacent rivers (pre- and post-treatment effluent, upstream, and downstream). Culture-based ESBL and general E. coli concentrations were estimated via the WHO Tricycle Protocol, while isolates (n = 42) were sequenced (MinION, MiSeq) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing conducted (Sensititre). Results: The Tricycle Protocol results provided estimates of effluent and river concentrations of ESBL and general E. coli identifying ESBL-to-general E. coli ratios of 13.8% and 6.2%, respectively. Compared to hybrid sequencing assemblies, MinION had a higher concordance than MiSeq for ARG identification (98%), virulence genes (96%), and locations for both (predominately plasmids). Furthermore, MinION concordance with Sensititre AST was 91%.

141,2025,Development of a Selective Agar for the Detection of Probiotic Strain Ligilactobacillus animalis NP51 and Other Lactic Acid Bacteria in Cattle Feed,"The enormous potential of bacteriotherapy in disease treatment and prevention has created a large probiotic market. Significant challenges exist in assessing probiotic quality, efficacy and viability. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are commonly used probiotics and the most abundant of the vertebrate microbiota. The goal of this study was to make MRS agar specific for probiotic Ligilactobacillus animalis NP51, since the current formulation is not sufficiently selective. Here, 53 chemicals were screened to identify compound(s) that reduced the growth of non-LAB and fungi on de Mann, Rogosa, and Sharpe (MRS) agar, and which were selective for LAB and specifically the probiotic strain NP51. Cattle feed was selected as the sample type, as it is commonly amended with Lactobacillus or yeast probiotics and often includes silage, a diverse microbial consortium of fungi and LAB. Modified MRS was evaluated for its effectiveness in determining probiotic viability and the detection of L. animalis NP51 in cattle feed, amended with this probiotic. qPCR was used to specifically detect and enumerate NP51 in commercial and experimental feed samples. For four selective agents, nystatin, guanidine hydrochloride, CuSO4, and ZnCl, it was identified that when used together, they reduced the growth of bacteria and fungi, but did not inhibit the Lactobacillus probiotic NP51 and other LAB. Metagenomic analysis revealed LAB as the major group cultivated on modified MRS agar from the plating of cattle feed amended with silage. As an enrichment, modified MRS broth improved the qPCR detection of probiotic strain NP51. This study illustrated that improvements can be made to existing bacteriological media for enumerating probiotic NP51 and determining the product’s viability.","Bacteria, Microbiome",,"(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Health & Disease

Simultaneously, the distributions of flora, fauna, fungi, microbes and pathogens are rapidly changing. Novel technology can help to capture and record genetic diversity before it is lost and to measure population shifts and pathogen distributions. Here we report the rapid application of shotgun long-read environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis for non-invasive biodiversity, genetic diversity and pathogen assessments from air. We also compared air eDNA with water and soil eDNA. Coupling long-read sequencing with established cloud-based biodiversity pipelines enabled a 2-day turnaround from airborne sample collection to completed analysis by a single investigator. To determine the full utility of airborne eDNA, we also conducted a local bioinformatic analysis and deep short-read shotgun sequencing. From outdoor air eDNA alone, comprehensive genetic analysis was performed, including population genetics (phylogenetic placement) of a charismatic mammal (bobcat, Lynx rufus) and a venomous spider (golden silk orb weaver, Trichonephila clavipes), and haplotyping humans (Homo sapiens) from natural complex community settings, such as subtropical forests and temperate locations. The rich datasets also enabled deeper analysis of specific species and genomic regions of interest, including viral variant calling, human variant analysis and antimicrobial resistance gene surveillance from airborne DNA. Our results highlight the speed, versatility and specificity of pan-biodiversity monitoring via non-invasive eDNA sampling using current benchtop/portable and cloud-based approaches.

143,2025,Differences in composition and potential function of the bacterial communities of cave- and surface-dwelling Mexican salamanders,"Caves are a challenging environment for many organisms to inhabit, and many cave-dwelling animals are endemic to particular cave systems. Microorganisms in caves have been shown to have a high biosynthetic capacity, likely as a result of intense biological interactions to deal with resource scarcity. Although cave salamanders have been studied extensively in other parts of the world, they have received relatively little attention in Mexico. Declines of some cave-dwelling species may be due to outbreaks of fungal disease, and a better understanding of their cutaneous microbiome could help with future conservation efforts in the face of disease outbreaks. We characterized the cutaneous microbiome of 11 cave-dwelling Mexican salamanders and their relatives from surface environments using high-throughput 16S amplicon sequencing. We expected cave salamanders to have a more diverse microbiome containing more bacteria with potential antifungal capacity compared to forest salamanders. We also estimated networks of associations between bacteria to test the hypothesis that there are more positive associations in caves. Finally, we used a bioinformatic approach to see if bacteria in caves potentially have more metabolic pathways associated with microbial communication as a result of more intense biological interactions in caves. Although we do not find higher skin bacterial diversity in caves compared to forests, we do find differences in microbiome composition between environments, more positive associations between bacteria, and a slightly higher number of metabolic pathways associated with microbial communication in caves. Our results provide some support for an impact of the cave environment on the skin microbiome of Mexican salamanders.

144,2025,A novel silver-ruthenium-based antimicrobial kills Gram-negative bacteria through oxidative stress-induced macromolecular damage,"ABSTRACT Amplified by the decline in antibiotic discovery, the rise of antibiotic resistance has become a significant global challenge in infectious disease control. Extraintestinal Escherichia coli (ExPEC), known to be the most common instigators of urinary tract infections (UTIs), represents such a global threat. Novel strategies for more efficient treatments are therefore desperately needed. These include silver nanoparticles, which have been used as antimicrobial surface coatings on catheters to eliminate biofilm-forming uropathogens and reduce the risk of nosocomial infections. AGXX is a promising silver-ruthenium coating that presumably kills bacteria through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, neither AGXX’s mode of action is fully understood, nor have its effects on Gram-negative bacteria or bacterial response and defense mechanisms toward AGXX been studied in detail. Here, we report that the bactericidal effects of AGXX are primarily based on ROS formation, as supplementation of the media with a ROS scavenger completely abolished AGXX-induced killing. We further show that AGXX impairs the integrity of the bacterial cell envelope and causes substantial protein aggregation and DNA damage already at sublethal concentrations. ExPEC strains appear to be more resistant to the proteotoxic effects of AGXX compared to non-pathogenic E. coli, indicating improved defense capabilities of the uropathogen. Global transcriptomic studies of AGXX-stressed ExPEC revealed a strong oxidative stress response, perturbations in metal homeostasis, as well as the activation of heat shock and DNA damage responses. Finally, we present evidence that ExPEC counteracts AGXX damage through the production of the chaperone polyphosphate, protecting cells from protein aggregation. IMPORTANCE The rise in drug-resistant bacteria, together with the decline in antibiotic development, requires new strategies for infectious disease control. Gram-negative pathogens are particularly challenging to combat due to their outer membrane. This study highlights the effectiveness of the silver-containing antimicrobial AGXX against the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. AGXX effectively reduces bacterial survival by interfering with the membrane integrity and causing DNA damage and protein aggregation, which is likely a consequence of uncontrolled generation of oxidative stress. Our findings emphasize AGXX’s potential as an antimicrobial surface coating and shed light on potential targets to reduce bacterial resistance to AGXX.

145,2025,Inoculation of apple plantlets with Rhodococcus pseudokoreensis R79T enhances diversity and modulates the structure of bacterial rhizosphere communities in soil affected by apple replant disease,"Background Apple replant disease (ARD) represents a dysbiotic rhizosphere condition potentially driven by root exudates including phytoalexins at the root–soil interface. A promising mitigation strategy could be the application of bioinoculants that reduce these compounds and foster a diverse microbiome. This study investigated the effects of Rhodococcus pseudokoreensis R79T, a strain with benzoate-degrading capabilities and genetic potential to degrade biphenyls, on the rhizosphere microbiome of apple plantlets grown in ARD-affected soil in a greenhouse experiment. Results We applied R79T at 10⁶ to 10⁹ CFU/ml, assessing its impact on bacterial 16S rRNA diversity and abundance, as well as the abundance of biphenyl dioxygenase (bphd) genes. Eight weeks post-inoculation reads of strain R79T persisted in the rhizosphere, particularly at higher inoculation levels. Inoculation enhanced bacterial diversity and bphd gene abundance, with significant shifts in community composition. Key responders included members of Gaiellales, which increased, and Streptomyces, which decreased. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that inoculation promoted positive interactions, more homogeneous connectivity, and a higher degree of connections. Effects on bacterial community structure varied significantly with inoculation concentration. Conclusions The fact that R79T enhanced rhizosphere bacterial diversity and modulated community composition in ARD-affected soil highlights the potential of R79T to reshape microbial interactions. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these effects, including studies on in situ degradation of phytoalexins and inoculation of R79T alongside bacteria for plant growth promotion (PGP) in synthetic communities for elevated efficiency against ARD.

146,2025,"Stage-specific transcriptomic analysis reveals insights into the development, reproduction and biological function of allergens in the European house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus","Background House dust mites (HDMs) such as Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus are major allergy elicitors worldwide, yet their gene expression across developmental stages remains underexplored. Herein, we report a comprehensive RNAseq analysis of larvae, nymphs, and adult males and females, mapped to a recently published high-quality genome with extended functional annotations. Results Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEG) revealed that female-biased expression was the most prevalent profile (16% of genes), while males exhibited the highest fold-change differences. DEG data, combined with network clustering and functional enrichment analysis, highlighted distinct genes and biological processes for each stage and sex: females showed upregulation of genes related to cell division and oogenesis, with vitellogenins among the most abundant transcripts; males exhibited increased expression of genes encoding putative seminal fluid proteins (e.g. endopeptidases, serpins, antimicrobial peptides), and those involved in reproductive regulation (e.g. testis-specific serine kinases); while juveniles displayed enhanced expression of genes related to energy metabolism and growth. Further analysis of endocrine pathways revealed non-canonic mechanisms compared to insect models, particularly in ecdysteroid and sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis and regulation. Expression patterns in genes involved in cuticle formation were also identified, reflecting their role in developmental transitions and sexual differentiation. Allergen and allergen-related gene expression showed an overall increase in feeding juveniles, as well as sex-biased expression, with Der p 27 upregulated in females. These findings provide insight into the physiological roles of allergens in digestion, immunity, and muscle formation, among other functions. Additionally, seven new horizontally transferred genes, including a DNA-repair photolyase linked to females, and novel multigene families (e.g. 119 male-specific beta-propeller proteins, 70 hypothetical cuticular proteins, 23 tetraspanin-like proteins, 5 female-associated putative odorant-binding proteins) were identified. Conclusions This study provides the first genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of a HDM across life stages and sexes, expanding our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying mite development, sexual reproduction, and allergen expression. The generated data, fully available via supplementary spreadsheet and the ORCAE online platform, provide a valuable foundation for future allergy research and the development of new mite control strategies.

147,2025,The effects of silver nitrate on Mycobacterium abscessus biofilms in a simulated antimicrobial showerhead environment,"Antimicrobial silver materials for drinking water disinfection have become increasingly popular in building-wide systems (e.g., copper-silver ionization) and point-of-use applications (e.g., silver containing plumbing fixtures) to combat the microbial growth of drinking water associated pathogens that can cause infections in the immunocompromised (DWPIs). However, evaluations of various silver-containing treatments suggest that their efficacy is often temporary or incomplete. A potential explanation of these observations is insufficient dosing of silver into the drinking water to reduce these types of microorganisms, which are known to be more resistant to biocides. Instead, sublethal exposure may cause these microorganisms to adapt in ways that increase their resistance to disinfection. In this study, we assessed the effects of different silver concentrations on biofilms of clinically and environmentally isolated Mycobacterium abscessus, a biofilm-forming member of the drinking water microbiota with public health and environmental significance, in a bench-scale system operated to simulated the use patterns of antimicrobial showerheads. We found that high concentrations of silver significantly reduced biofilms cell densities and impacted cellular aggregation behavior, but ultimately made the resulting treated water non-potable due to the concentration of silver needed to solicit these effects. Silver concentrations that were more appropriate for drinking water applications resulting in limited reduction in viable M. abscessus. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis revealed that genes related to stress survival were upregulated in all experimental conditions: genes related to flavoprotein, chaperone, and protease synthesis, ribosome synthesis, and cysteine and methionine metabolism were upregulated in the lower dose condition, and peptidoglycan synthesis and antioxidant production were upregulated in the higher silver dose condition. These expressional changes may enhance survival and pathogenicity traits in M. abscessus after silver exposure. Overall, our findings indicate that silver exposure drives meaningful changes in biofilm behavior and gene expression in M. abscessus isolates, yet does not inactivate M. abscessus under the simulated conditions.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Isolate, AMR",(Meta)transcriptomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
148,2025,A Tutorial Toolbox to Simplify Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Analyses of Microbial Omics Data in an Island Context,"Background: Bioinformatics is increasingly used in various scientific works. Large amounts of heterogeneous data are being generated these days. It is difficult to interpret and analyze these data effectively. Several software tools have been developed to facilitate the handling and analysis of biological data, based on specific needs. Methods: The Galaxy web platform is one of these software tools, allowing free access to users and facilitating the use of thousands of tools. Other software tools, such as Bioconda or Jupyter Notebook, facilitate the installation of tools and their dependencies. In addition to these tools, RStudio can be mentioned as a powerful interface that facilitates the use of the R programming language for data analysis and statistics. Results: The aim of this study is to provide the scientific community with guides on how to perform bioinformatics/biostatistical analyses in a simpler manner. With this work, we also try to democratize well-documented software tools to make them suitable for both bioinformaticians and non-bioinformaticians. We believe that user-friendly guides and real-life/concrete examples will provide end-users with suitable and easy-to-use methods for their bioinformatics analysis needs. Furthermore, tutorials and usage examples are available on our dedicated GitHub repository. Conclusions: These tutorials/examples (In English and/or French) could be used as pedagogical tools to promote bioinformatics analysis and offer potential solutions to several bioinformatics needs.

149,2025,Presence of microplastic particles increased abundance of pathogens and antimicrobial resistance genes in microbial communities from the Oder river water and sediment,"High abundance of microplastic particles (MPs) in the water environment could be a factor in spreading of pathogens and antimicrobial resistance genes (AMR), especially antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The aim of our study was to assess changes in the microbial community developing on microplastic surfaces incubated in water from the Oder River—one of Central Europe’s major rivers, flowing through three countries (Czechia, Germany, and Poland)—whose diverse, 20,000-km2 catchment area (encompassing industrial, agricultural, and urban regions) ensures a relatively high abundance of microbial communities.Samples of water and sediment were taken from river in Wroclaw area. Then the water was poured into disinfected glass liquid containers and pre-drained sediment was added. Control samples of water and sediment were collected on day 0. Then microplastic particles were added (500 mg; ~ 1 mm). Subsequent sampling was performed after incubation on 7th and 14th day. From each group, samples of sediment and water were collected after the incubation period (n = 5/group), for extraction of microbial DNA and library preparation. Sequencing was performed, using MinION sequencer with 10.4.1 Flow cell. Galaxy Europe platform and R program (v 4.3.3), alpha diversity and PERMANOVA with Benjamini–Hochberg p-value correction for multiple comparisons were used. For identification of biomarker taxa being different between groups, ANCOMBC (Analysis of Compositions of Microbiomes with Bias Correction) was performed. Obtained results shown higher abundance of pathogenic bacteria such as Aeromonas salmonicida Vibrio spp., Escherichia coli or Salmonella after 7 days of incubation in water and sediment. Additionally, after 7 days of incubation numbers of ARGs was higher compared to control group.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR, Gene identification / Biomarker",,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
150,2025,Structural Characterisation of TetR/AcrR Regulators in Streptomyces fildesensis So13.3: An In Silico CRISPR-Based Strategy to Influence the Suppression of Actinomycin D Production,"The growing threat of antimicrobial resistance has intensified the search for new bioactive compounds, particularly in extreme environments such as Antarctica. Streptomyces fildesensis So13.3, isolated from Antarctic soil, harbours a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) associated with actinomycin D production, an antibiotic with biomedical relevance. This study investigates the regulatory role of TetR/AcrR transcription factors encoded within this biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC), focusing on their structural features and expression under different nutritional conditions. Additionally, we propose that repressing an active pathway could lead to the activation of silent biosynthetic routes, and our in-silico analysis provides a foundation for selecting key mutations and experimentally validating this strategy. Expression analysis revealed that TetR-279, in particular, was upregulated in ISP4 and IMA media, suggesting its participation in nutrient-dependent BGC regulation. Structural modelling identified key differences between TetR-206 and TetR-279, with the latter containing a tetracycline-repressor-like domain. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed TetR-279’s structural stability but showed that the S166P CRISPy-web-guided mutation considerably affected its flexibility, while V167A and V167I had modest effects. These results underscore the importance of integrating omics, structural prediction, and gene editing to evaluate and manipulate transcriptional regulation in non-model bacteria. Targeted disruption of TetR-279 may derepress actinomycin biosynthesis, enabling access to silent or cryptic secondary metabolites with potential pharmaceutical applications.",Bacteria,"Isolate, AMR",Metabolomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
151,2025,Destabilization of mutualistic interactions shapes the early heat stress response of the coral holobiont,"Background The stability of the symbiotic relationship between coral and their dinoflagellate algae (Symbiodiniaceae) is disrupted by ocean warming. Although the coral thermal response depends on the complex interactions between host, Symbiodiniaceae and prokaryotes, the mechanisms underlying the initial destabilization of these symbioses are poorly understood. Results In a 2-month manipulative experiment, we exposed the coral Porites lutea to gradually increasing temperatures corresponding to 0–8 degree heating weeks (DHW) and assessed the response of the coral holobiont using coral and Symbiodiniaceae transcriptomics, microbial 16S rRNA gene sequencing and physiological measurements. From early stages of heat stress (< 1 DHW), the increase in metabolic turnover shifted the holobiont to a net heterotrophic state in which algal-derived nutrients were insufficient to meet host energy demands, resulting in reduced holobiont performance at 1 DHW. We postulate the altered nutrient cycling also affected the coral-associated microbial community, with the relative abundance of Endozoicomonas bacteria declining under increasing heat stress. Integration of holobiont stress responses correlated this decline to an increase in expression of a host ADP-ribosylation factor, suggesting that Symbiodiniaceae and Endozoicomonas may underlie similar endosymbiotic regulatory processes. Conclusions The thermotolerance of coral holobionts therefore is influenced by the nutritional status of its members and their interactions, and this identified metabolic interdependency highlights the importance of applying an integrative approach to guide coral reef conservation efforts.

152,2025,Fecal microbiota changes associated with pathogenic and non-pathogenic diarrheas in foals,"Objectives Diarrhea is a common disease that could threaten the welfare of newborn foals. While there are several forms of foal diarrhea, the etiologies can be considered known pathogenic or non-pathogenic in nature. Moreover, there are likely differences in the composition of microbial populations in the gastrointestinal tracts of foals depending upon the etiology of diarrhea. Our study aims to examine the microbial population in the feces of foals with both pathogenic and non-pathogenic diarrheas to discern differences in their microbial compositions. Results Foal diarrhea samples tested positive or negative for common equine neonatal diarrhea pathogens by diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which allowed for samples to be segregated as pathogenic or non-pathogenic. Pathogenic samples tested positive for combinations of Clostridium perfringens and/or Clostridioides difficile toxins. As a result, significantly higher alpha diversity was seen in the non-pathogenic samples than in pathogenic ones. Sequencing of the V4 domains of bacterial 16 S rRNA genes demonstrated that non-pathogenic samples had more alpha diversity. Furthermore, eight microbial families and eleven genera showed significant differences in their abundances between pathogenic and non-pathogenic diarrhea samples.

153,2025,"Galaxy @Sciensano: a comprehensive bioinformatics portal for genomics-based microbial typing, characterization, and outbreak detection","The influx of whole genome sequencing (WGS) data in the public health and clinical diagnostic sectors has created a need for data analysis methods and bioinformatics expertise, which can be a bottleneck for many laboratories. At Sciensano, the Belgian national public health institute, an intuitive and user-friendly bioinformatics tool portal was implemented using Galaxy, an open-source platform for data analysis and workflow creation. The Galaxy @Sciensano instance is available to both internal and external scientists and offers a wide range of tools provided by the community, complemented by over 50 custom tools and pipelines developed in-house. The tool selection is currently focused primarily on the analysis of WGS data generated using Illumina sequencing for microbial pathogen typing, characterization and outbreak detection, but it also addresses specific use cases for other data types. Our Galaxy instance includes several custom-developed 'push-button' pipelines, which are user-friendly and intuitive stand-alone tools that perform complete characterization of bacterial isolates based on WGS data and generate interactive HTML output reports with key findings. These pipelines include quality control, de novo assembly, sequence typing, antimicrobial resistance prediction and several relevant species-specific assays. They are tailored for pathogens with active genomic surveillance programs, and clinical relevance, such as Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp. and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These tools and pipelines utilize internationally recognized databases such as PubMLST, EnteroBase, and the NCBI National Database of Antibiotic Resistant Organisms, which are automatically synchronized on a regular basis to ensure up-to-date results. Many of these pipelines are part of the routine activities of Belgian national reference centers and laboratories, some of which use them under ISO accreditation. This resource is publicly available for noncommercial use at https://galaxy.sciensano.be/ and can help other laboratories establish reliable, traceable and reproducible bioinformatics analyses for pathogens encountered in public health settings.

154,2025,A Novel Silver-Ruthenium-Based Antimicrobial Kills Gram-Negative Bacteria Through Oxidative Stress-Induced Macromolecular Damage,"Amplified by the decline in antibiotic discovery, the rise of antibiotic resistance has become a significant global challenge in infectious disease control. Extraintestinal Escherichia coli (ExPEC), known to be the most common instigators of urinary tract infections (UTIs), represent such global threat. Novel strategies for more efficient treatments are therefore desperately needed. These include silver nanoparticles, which have been used as antimicrobial surface-coatings on catheters to eliminate biofilm-forming uropathogens and reduce the risk of nosocomial infections. AGXX® is a promising silver coating that presumably kills bacteria through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) but is more potent than silver. However, neither is AGXX®’s mode of action fully understood, nor have its effects on Gram-negative bacteria or bacterial response and defense mechanisms towards AGXX® been studied in detail. Here, we report that the bactericidal effects of AGXX® are primarily based on ROS formation, as supplementation of the media with a ROS scavenger completely abolished AGXX®-induced killing. We further show that AGXX® impairs the integrity of the bacterial cell envelope and causes substantial protein aggregation and DNA damage already at sublethal concentrations. ExPEC strains appear to be more resistant to the proteotoxic effects of AGXX® compared to non-pathogenic E. coli, indicating improved defense capabilities of the uropathogen. Global transcriptomic studies of AGXX®-stressed ExPEC revealed a strong oxidative stress response, perturbations in metal homeostasis, as well as the activation of heat shock and DNA damage responses. Finally, we present evidence that ExPEC counter AGXX® damage through the production of the chaperone polyphosphate.","Bacteria, Pathogen",AMR,(Meta)transcriptomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

156,2024,Phylosymbiosis and Elevated Cancer Risk in Genetically Depauperate Channel Island Foxes,"Examination of the host‐associated microbiome in wildlife can provide critical insights into the eco‐evolutionary factors driving species diversification and response to disease. This is particularly relevant for isolated populations lacking genomic variation, a phenomenon that is increasingly common as human activities create habitat ‘islands’ for wildlife. Here, we characterised the gut and otic microbial communities of one such species: Channel Island foxes (Urocyon littoralis). The gut microbiome provided evidence of phylosymbiosis by reflecting the host phylogeny, geographic proximity, history of island colonisation and contemporary ecological differences, whereas the otic microbiome primarily reflected geography and disease. Santa Catalina Island foxes are uniquely predisposed to ceruminous gland tumours following infection with Otodectes cynotis ear mites, while San Clemente and San Nicolas Island foxes exhibit ear mite infections without evidence of tumours. Comparative analyses of otic microbiomes revealed that mite‐infected Santa Catalina and San Clemente Island foxes exhibited reduced bacterial diversity, skewed abundance towards the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and disrupted microbial community networks. However, Santa Catalina Island foxes uniquely harboured Fusobacterium and Prevotella bacteria as potential keystone taxa. These bacteria have previously been associated with colorectal cancer and may predispose Santa Catalina Island foxes to an elevated cancer risk. In contrast, mite‐infected San Nicolas Island foxes maintained high bacterial diversity and robust microbial community networks, suggesting that they harbour more resilient microbiomes. Considered together, our results highlight the diverse eco‐evolutionary factors influencing commensal microbial communities and their hosts and underscore how the microbiome can contribute to disease outcomes.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, Comparative analysis",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

158,2024,Isolation and Characterization of Lytic Bacteriophages Capable of Infecting Diverse Multidrug-Resistant Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: PaCCP1 and PaCCP2,"Background/Objectives: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major public health threat, which is exacerbated by the lack of new antibiotics and the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) superbugs. Comprehensive efforts and alternative strategies to combat AMR are urgently needed to prevent social, medical, and economic consequences. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a pathogen responsible for a wide range of infections, from soft tissue infections to life-threatening conditions such as bacteremia and pneumonia. Bacteriophages have been considered as a potential therapeutic option to treat bacterial infections. Our aim was to isolate phages able to infect MDR P. aeruginosa strains. Methods: We isolated two lytic phages, using the conventional double layer agar technique (DLA), from samples obtained from the influent of a wastewater treatment plant in Concepción, Chile. The phages, designated as PaCCP1 and PaCCP2, were observed by electron microscopy and their host range was determined against multiple P. aeruginosa strains using DLA. Moreover, their genomes were sequenced and analyzed. Results: Phage PaCCP1 is a member of the Septimatrevirus genus and phage PaCCP2 is a member of the Pbunavirus genus. Both phages are tailed and contain dsDNA. The genome of PaCCP1 is 43,176 bp in length with a GC content of 54.4%, encoding 59 ORFs, one of them being a tRNA gene. The genome of PaCCP2 is 66,333 bp in length with a GC content of 55.6%, encoding 102 non-tRNA ORFs. PaCCP1 is capable of infecting five strains of P. aeruginosa, whereas phage PaCCP2 is capable of infecting three strains of P. aeruginosa. Both phages do not contain bacterial virulence or AMR genes and contain three and six putative Anti-CRISPR proteins. Conclusions: Phages PaCCP1 and PaCCP2 show promise as effective treatments for MDR P. aeruginosa strains, offering a potential strategy for controlling this clinically important pathogen through phage therapy.","Bacteria, Virus, Pathogen","Isolate, AMR",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
159,2024,Infants < 90 days of age with late-onset sepsis display disturbances of the microbiome-immunity interplay,"Objective We hypothesized that previously healthy infants < 90 days of age with late-onset sepsis (LOS) have disturbances of the gut microbiome with yet undefined specific immunological patterns. Methods We performed a prospective single-center convenience sample study between January 2019 and July 2021 in a case-control design. Routine diagnostics included conventional cultures (blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine), PCRs and inflammatory markers in infants aged < 90 days with clinical LOS. We additionally analyzed blood lymphocyte subsets including CD4 + CD25 + forkhead box protein (FoxP3)+ Tregs and performed 16 S rRNA sequencing of stool samples, both compared to age-matched healthy controls. Results were adjusted for potential confounders that may influence microbial composition. Results 51 infants with fever and clinical LOS were enrolled. Bacterial sepsis was diagnosed in n = 24 (47.1%) and viral infection in n = 13 (25.5%) infants, whereas in 14 (27.3%) infants the cause of fever remained undetermined. When compared to healthy controls, the gut microbiome of LOS infants at disease onset was characterized by a shift in community composition, specifically, decreased abundance of B. longum and an increase of Bacteroidia spp. Intriguingly, the abundance of B. longum negatively correlated with the frequency of blood CD4-positive cells in healthy controls but not in infants with LOS. At one year of age, we observed microbiome differences in infants with history of LOS when compared to healthy controls, such as an increased gut microbial diversity. Conclusion Our data suggest potential signatures of the microbiome-immunity interplay in infants with LOS, which should be investigated further as possible targets for prevention.

160,2024,"Microbial succession, community assembly and adaptation over five years in a newly discovered deep-sea cold seep","Deep-sea cold seeps, characterized by the release of hydrocarbon-rich fluids such as methane from the seafloor, create unique ecosystems with evolving biological communities. Microorganisms serve as pioneers, initially colonizing early-stage cold seeps and providing essential matter and energy for subsequent colonizers. However, microbial succession, community assembly, and adaptation in these environments remain largely unexplored due to challenges associated with locating early-stage cold seeps. Here, we collected sediment samples from a newly discovered early-stage cold seep site, QDN-W07, in the South China Sea at varying depths over five years. We also sampled two previously reported cold seep sites, QDN-S18 and HM-ROV01, for comparative analysis. Amplicon sequencing revealed a high relative abundance of ANME-3 (up to 99%) and Methylomonadaceae (up to 83%) in surface sediments, and indicated changes in microbial community structures over time. Dispersal limitation dominated community assembly, while the contribution of homogeneous selection decreased over time, accompanied by a declined in the intensity of microbial association. Metagenomic analysis of core microbiome, comprising 172 metagenomic-assembled genomes at QDN-W07, revealed tolerance to low temperatures and oxygen. Core microbiome genomes were enriched with genes related to aerobic methane oxidation, urea metabolism, and the oxidation of sulfur, ammonia and carbon monoxide. These results indicate that core microorganisms obtain energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds, allowing them to thrive in cold, methane-rich and unstable conditions. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of deep biosphere life, biogeochemical cycling, and the ecological management of cold seep environments.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, MAGs, Comparative analysis","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
161,2024,Exploring genetic determinants of antimicrobial resistance in Brucella melitensis strains of human and animal origin from India,"Introduction Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Brucella melitensis, the causative agent of brucellosis, is of growing concern, particularly in low and middle-income countries. This study aimed to explore the genetic basis of AMR in B. melitensis strains from India. Methods Twenty-four isolates from humans and animals were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing and whole-genome sequencing. Results Resistance to doxycycline (20.80%), ciprofloxacin (16.67%), cotrimoxazole (4.17%), and rifampicin (16.67%) was observed. Genome analysis revealed efflux-related genes like mprF, bepG, bepF, bepC, bepE, and bepD across all isolates, however, classical AMR genes were not detected. Mutations in key AMR-associated genes such as rpoB, gyrA, and folP were identified, intriguingly present in both resistant and susceptible isolates, suggesting a complex genotype–phenotype relationship in AMR among Brucella spp. Additionally, mutations in efflux genes were noted in resistant and some susceptible isolates, indicating their potential role in resistance mechanisms. However, mutations in AMR-associated genes did not consistently align with phenotypic resistance, suggesting a multifactorial basis for resistance. Discussion The study underscores the complexity of AMR in B. melitensis and advocates for a holistic multi-omics approach to fully understand resistance mechanisms. These findings offer valuable insights into genetic markers associated with AMR, guiding future research and treatment strategies.",,"Isolate, AMR",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease
162,2024,Hydrothermal vents supporting persistent plumes and microbial chemoautotrophy at Gakkel Ridge (Arctic Ocean),"Hydrothermal vents emit hot fluids enriched in energy sources for microbial life. Here, we compare the ecological and biogeochemical effects of hydrothermal venting of two recently discovered volcanic seamounts, Polaris and Aurora of the Gakkel Ridge, in the ice-covered Central Arctic Ocean. At both sites, persistent hydrothermal plumes increased up to 800 m into the deep Arctic Ocean. In the two non-buoyant plumes, rates of microbial carbon fixation were strongly elevated compared to background values of 0.5–1 μmol m−3 day−1 in the Arctic deep water, which suggests increased chemoautotrophy on vent-derived energy sources. In the Polaris plume, free sulfide and up to 360 nM hydrogen enabled microorganisms to fix up to 46 μmol inorganic carbon (IC) m−3 day−1. This energy pulse resulted in a strong increase in the relative abundance of SUP05 by 25% and Candidatus Sulfurimonas pluma by 7% of all bacteria. At Aurora, microorganisms fixed up to 35 μmol IC m−3 day−1. Here, metal sulfides limited the bioavailability of reduced sulfur species, and the putative hydrogen oxidizer Ca. S. pluma constituted 35% and SUP05 10% of all bacteria. In accordance with this data, transcriptomic analysis showed a high enrichment of hydrogenase-coding transcripts in Aurora and an enrichment of transcripts coding for sulfur oxidation in Polaris. There was neither evidence for methane consumption nor a substantial increase in the abundance of putative methanotrophs or their transcripts in either plume. Together, our results demonstrate the dominance of hydrogen and sulfide as energy sources in Arctic hydrothermal vent plumes.",Bacteria,,(Meta)transcriptomics,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
163,2024,Four New Sequence Types and Molecular Characteristics of Multidrug-Resistant Escherichia coli Strains from Foods in Thailand,"The presence of antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli in food is a serious and persistent problem worldwide. In this study, 68 E. coli strains isolated from Thai food samples were characterized. Based on antibiotic susceptibility assays, 31 of these isolates (45.59%) showed multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index values > 0.2, indicating high exposure to antibiotics. Among these, strain CM24E showed the highest resistance (it was resistant to ten antibiotics, including colistin and imipenem). Based on genome sequencing, we identified four isolates (namely, CF25E, EF37E, NM10E1, and SF50E) with novel Achtman-scheme multi-locus sequence types (STs) (ST14859, ST14866, ST14753, and ST14869, respectively). Clermont phylogrouping was used to subtype the 68 researched isolates into five Clermont types, mainly A (51.47%) and B1 (41.18%). The blaEC gene was found only in Clermont type A, while the blaEC-13 gene was predominant in Clermont type B1. A correlation between genotypes and phenotypes was found only in Clermont type B1, which showed a strong positive correlation between the presence of an afa operon and yersiniabactin-producing gene clusters with the colistin resistance phenotype. Strain SM47E1, of Clermont type B2, carried the highest number of predicted virulence genes.

164,2024,Gut microbiome and serum metabolome alterations associated with lactose intolerance (LI): a case‒control study and paired-sample study based on the American Gut Project (AGP),"ABSTRACT Lactose intolerance (LI) is a prevalent condition characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms that arise following lactose consumption. Recent evidence suggests that the gut microbiome may influence lactose levels in the gut. However, there is limited understanding regarding the alterations in microbiota and metabolism between individuals with LI and non-LI. This study conducted a paired-sample investigation utilizing data from the American Gut Project (AGP) and performed metagenomic and untargeted metabolomic analyses in a Chinese cohort to explore the interaction between the gut microbiome and serum metabolites. In addition, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments were conducted to further examine the impact of the LI-associated gut microbiome on inflammatory outcomes. We identified 14 microbial genera that significantly differed between LI and controls from AGP data. Using a machine learning approach, group separation was predicted based on seven species and nine metabolites in the Chinese cohort. Notably, increased levels of Escherichia coli in the LI group were negatively correlated with several metabolites, including PC (22:6/0:0), indole, and Lyso PC, while reduced levels of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Eubacterium rectale were positively correlated with indole and furazolidone. FMT-LI rats displayed visceral hypersensitivity and an altered gut microbiota composition compared to FMT-HC rats. Metagenomic and metabolomic analyses revealed an enrichment of MAPK signaling in LI, which was confirmed by FMT-LI rats showing higher expression of ERK and RAS, along with increased concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines. This study provides valuable insights into the disrupted microbial and metabolic traits associated with LI, emphasizing potential microbiome-based approaches for its prevention and treatment. IMPORTANCE Lactose intolerance (LI) is a prevalent condition characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms after lactose consumption due to a deficiency of lactase. There is limited understanding regarding the microbiota and metabolic alterations between individuals with LI and non-LI. This study represents the first exploration to investigate metagenomic and metabolomic signatures among subjects with lactose intolerance as far as our knowledge. We identified 14 microbial genera in the Western cohort and 7 microbial species, along with 9 circulating metabolites in the Chinese cohort, which significantly differed in LI patients. Metagenomic and metabolomic analyses revealed an enrichment of MAPK signaling in LI patients. This finding was confirmed by FMT-LI rats, exhibiting increased expression of ERK and RAS, along with higher concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Our study provides insights into the disrupted functional and metabolic traits of the gut microbiome in LI, highlighting potential microbiome-based approaches for preventing and treating LI.

A total of 33 quinolone derivatives were assessed for their physicochemical properties and effectiveness against a range of clinically relevant pathogens, including methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. Molecular docking studies identified compounds 28, 29, 32, and 33 as having notable binding affinities, particularly against MRSA. Further molecular dynamics simulations of compound 29 confirmed its favorable stability and potential for disrupting MRSA, reinforcing the docking results and showing strong alignment with in vitro findings. These findings position compound 29 as a promising lead for developing alternative MRSA therapies and underscore the need for further in vivo studies to evaluate its therapeutic potential.","Bacteria, Pathogen","Interactome, AMR",,Health & Disease
166,2024,In vivo evolution to hypermucoviscosity and ceftazidime/avibactam resistance in a liver abscess caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae sequence type 512,"ABSTRACT Carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae represents a major public health issue globally. Isolates with resistance to the newest drugs, like ceftazidime/avibactam (CZA), are increasingly reported. In this study, we analyzed the evolution of KPC-3-producing sequence type (ST) 512 K. pneumoniae strains isolated at three different times (hospitalization days 45, 56, and 78) from the same patient, two of which were observed in a pericholecystic liver abscess. The three K. pneumoniae isolates (295Kp, 304Kp, and hmv-318Kp) from the same patient were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, whole-genome sequencing, sedimentation assay, biofilm measurement, serum resistance assay, macrophage phagocytosis, and adhesion assays. KPC-producing isolate hmv-318Kp exhibited carbapenem susceptibility, hypermucoviscous (hmv) colony phenotype and CZA resistance. Virulence markers of hypervirulent Klebsiella were absent. Two non-synonymous mutations were identified in the hmv-318Kp genome comparing with isogenic strains: a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) occurred in the pKpQIL plasmid, changing blaKPC-3 in the blaKPC-31 gene variant, conferring CZA resistance; and a second SNP occurred in the wzc gene of the capsular biosynthesis cluster, encoding a tyrosine kinase, resulting in the F557S Wzc protein mutation. The Klebsiella pneumoniae strain exhibiting an hmv phenotype (hmv-Kp) phenotype has been previously associated with amino acid substitutions occurring in the Wzc tyrosin kinase protein. We observed in vivo evolution of the ST512 strain to CZA resistance and acquisition of hypermucoviscosity. The pathogenetic role of the detected Wzc substitution is not fully elucidated, but other Wzc mutations were previously reported in hmv K. pneumoniae. Wzc mutants may be more frequent than expected and an underreported cause of hypermucoviscosity in K. pneumoniae clinical isolates. IMPORTANCE Here we describe the evolution of KPC-3-producing ST512 K. pneumoniae isolated at three different times from the same patient of which the last one, from a biliary abscess, showed CZA resistance by KPC-31 production and manifested hmv colony phenotype. Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hv-Kp) isolates are increasingly reported worldwide. Their hypervirulent traits are associated with the presence of rmpA/A2 genes and an hmv. In this study, we identified an hmv-Kp that lacked the rmpA-D cluster but showed an amino acid substitution in the Wzc tyrosin kinase protein, involved in the capsular biosynthesis. This hmv-Kp strain emerged in vivo and evolved resistance to ceftazidime/avibactam resistance in a liver abscess of a patient. Our findings suggest that wzc mutations may be underreported, making it challenging to distinguish hv-Kp from “classic” K. pneumoniae with an hmv phenotype.

This hmv-Kp strain emerged in vivo and evolved resistance to ceftazidime/avibactam resistance in a liver abscess of a patient. Our findings suggest that wzc mutations may be underreported, making it challenging to distinguish hv-Kp from “classic” K. pneumoniae with an hmv phenotype.","Virus, Pathogen","Isolate, AMR, SNP, Variant",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

168,2024,"Anti-inflammatory response to 1,8-Cineol and associated microbial communities in Otitis media patients","Chronic Otitis Media (COM) is defined as long term inflammation and colonization with pathogenic bacteria due to a defect or retraction of the tympanic membrane. Surgical interventions are often augmented by antibiotic resistance development and therefore, off-label treatment using the natural drug 1,8-Cineol was carried out. All COM patients underwent antibiotic therapy and middle ear surgery and developed antibiotic resistances. Microbiological investigations from the auditory canal and stool samples were performed in correlation with the clinical course. Therapy of COM patients with 1,8-Cineol revealed a clear reduction of inflammatory microbes P. aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis in ear samples as well as intestinal Prevotella copri, which was associated with an improved clinical outcome in certain individuals. The present off-label study revealed manifold anti-inflammatory effects of the natural monoterpene 1,8-Cineol in Otitis media patients. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms will improve the current treatment options and possible forms of application of this natural drug.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR",,Health & Disease
169,2024,Co-evolution of Yeast and Microalga: Identification of mutations that improve cooperativity,"Laboratory-based evolution has long been successfully implemented for the generation of desired phenotypes in microbial strain development. The approach also provides insights into evolutionary mechanisms and adaptive molecular strategies which may be too complex to unravel in natural environments. The selection pressure in most of these approaches are physical or chemical factors or stressors, and only a few projects have attempted to use dynamic biotic selection pressures as a driver of evolution. Here we investigate the formation of novel cooperative phenotypes between the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the microalga Chlorella sorokiniana. A synthetic ecology approach based on the cross-feeding of carbon and nitrogen was used to establish an obligate mutualism between these species which allowed for prolonged physical contact in a continuous co-culture system over 100 generations. Comparative genomic analysis of co-evolved yeast strains identified several potentially high impact Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms. Of these, two genes ETP1 and GAT1, were found to synergistically contribute to the cooperative phenotype between yeast and microalgae These genes are involved in carbon (ETP1) and nitrogen catabolite (GAT1) repression with ETP1 encoding a protein of unknown function, but implicated in ethanol tolerance and control of Hxt3p, while GAT1 encodes a regulator of nitrogen catabolite repression. CRISPR generated null mutants of the parental (ancestral) yeast strain with either ETP1, GAT1 or both genes deleted, were shown to mimic the co-evolved phenotype with improved cooperativity observed when paired with Chlorella sorokiniana suggesting a possible role of these genes in the establishment of mutualisms between yeast and microalgae. Importance Multispecies cultures have tremendous biotechnological potential but are difficult to control and show unpredictable population dynamics. This research aims to comprehensively characterise the behaviour and attributes of co-cultured microbial species, with the aim of optimising their combined functionality in a targeted manner. Taken together, our results demonstrate the importance and efficacy of thoughtfully integrating biotic selection pressures into strain development projects. The data also provide insights into specific molecular adaptations that favour cooperative behaviour between species. The co-evolutionary dynamics between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other microbial species hold immense promise for unlocking novel insights into evolutionary biology, biotechnological applications, and our understanding of complex microbiological systems. Finally, the molecular characterisation of ecosystem-relevant traits provides significant impetus to the annotation of microbial genomes within an evolutionary relevant, multispecies context.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Annotation, Comparative analysis",(Meta)genomics,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
170,2024,Succession of the fungal community of a spacecraft assembly clean room when enriched in brines relevant to Mars,"Abstract Spacecraft can carry microbial contaminants from spacecraft assembly facilities (SAFs) to the cold arid surface of Mars that may confound life detection missions or disrupt native ecosystems. Dry hygroscopic sulphate and (per)chlorate salts on Mars may absorb atmospheric humidity and deliquesce at certain times to produce dense brines, potential sources of liquid water. Microbial growth is generally prohibited under the non-permissive condition of extremely low water activity in the frigid potential brines on Mars. Here we challenged the microbial community from samples of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory SAF with the extreme chemical conditions of brines relevant to Mars. Enrichment cultures in SP medium supplemented with 50% MgSO4 or 20% NaClO3 were inoculated from washes of SAF floor wipes. Samples were taken for each of the first four weeks and then at six months after inoculation to follow changes in the SAF microbial community under high salinity for long periods. Metagenomic DNA extracts of community samples were examined by Illumina sequencing of 18S rRNA gene sequences using fungal primers. The fungal assemblage during the first month of enrichment was predominantly common Ascomycetes, primarily Saccharomyete yeasts. Basidiomycetes were detected, mainly in the Microbotryomycetes and Tremellomycetes. Fungi were much less abundant in enrichment cultures at 50% MgSO4 than at 20% NaClO3. After 6 months of enrichment, few fungi remained. Microbes persisting from the JPL SAF microbial community in aged cultures enriched at extreme salinities might be the most capable of subsequently surviving and proliferating at the near surface of Mars. The SAF fungal assemblage did not survive and proliferate as well as the SAF bacterial community.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, MAGs","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

This study employed in silico analysis to identify genes, from Bacillus sp. strain MHSD_37, with potential biotechnological applications. Results The strain presented several endophytic lifestyle genes which encode for motility, quorum sensing, stress response, desiccation tolerance and root colonisation. The presence of plant growth promoting genes such as those involved in nitrogen fixation, nitrate assimilation, siderophores synthesis, seed germination and promotion of root nodule symbionts, was detected. Strain MHSD_37 also possessed genes involved in insect virulence and evasion of defence system. The genome analysis also identified the presence of genes involved in heavy metal tolerance, xenobiotic resistance, and the synthesis of siderophores involved in heavy metal tolerance. Furthermore, LC-MS analysis of the excretome identified secondary metabolites with biological activities such as anti-cancer, antimicrobial and applications as surfactants. Conclusions Strain MHSD_37 thereby demonstrated potential biotechnological application in bioremediation, biofertilisation and biocontrol.

172,2024,The prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbiome of Pacific oyster spat is shaped by ocean warming but not acidification,"ABSTRACT Pacific oysters (Magallana gigas, a.k.a. Crassostrea gigas), the most widely farmed oysters, are under threat from climate change and emerging pathogens. In part, their resilience may be affected by their microbiome, which, in turn, may be influenced by ocean warming and acidification. To understand these impacts, we exposed early-development Pacific oyster spat to different temperatures (18°C and 24°C) and pCO2 levels (800, 1,600, and 2,800 µatm) in a fully crossed design for 3 weeks. Under all conditions, the microbiome changed over time, with a large decrease in the relative abundance of potentially pathogenic ciliates (Uronema marinum) in all treatments with time. The microbiome composition differed significantly with temperature, but not acidification, indicating that Pacific oyster spat microbiomes can be altered by ocean warming but is resilient to ocean acidification in our experiments. Microbial taxa differed in relative abundance with temperature, implying different adaptive strategies and ecological specializations among microorganisms. Additionally, a small proportion (~0.2% of the total taxa) of the relatively abundant microbial taxa were core constituents (>50% occurrence among samples) across different temperatures, pCO2 levels, or time. Some taxa, including A4b bacteria and members of the family Saprospiraceae in the phyla Chloroflexi (syn. Chloroflexota) and Bacteroidetes (syn. Bacteroidota), respectively, as well as protists in the genera Labyrinthula and Aplanochytrium in the class Labyrinthulomycetes, and Pseudoperkinsus tapetis in the class Ichthyosporea were core constituents across temperatures, pCO2 levels, and time, suggesting that they play an important, albeit unknown, role in maintaining the structural and functional stability of the Pacific oyster spat microbiome in response to ocean warming and acidification. These findings highlight the flexibility of the spat microbiome to environmental changes. IMPORTANCE Pacific oysters are the most economically important and widely farmed species of oyster, and their production depends on healthy oyster spat. In turn, spat health and productivity are affected by the associated microbiota; yet, studies have not scrutinized the effects of temperature and pCO2 on the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbiomes of spat. Here, we show that both the prokaryotic and, for the first time, eukaryotic microbiome of Pacific oyster spat are surprisingly resilient to changes in acidification, but sensitive to ocean warming. The findings have potential implications for oyster survival amid climate change and underscore the need to understand temperature and pCO2 effects on the microbiome and the cascading effects on oyster health and productivity.

173,2024,"Minor impact of probiotic bacteria and egg white on Tenebrio molitor growth, microbial composition, and pathogen infection","The industrial rearing of the yellow mealworm (Tenebrio molitor) for feed and food purposes on agricultural by-products may expose larvae and adults to entomopathogens used as biocontrol agents in crop production. Bacterial spores/toxins or fungal conidia from species such as Bacillus thuringiensis or Metarhizium brunneum could affect the survival and growth of insects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the potential benefits of a wheat bran diet supplemented with probiotic bacteria and dried egg white on larval development and survival and its effects on the gut microbiome composition. Two probiotic bacterial species, Pediococcus pentosaceus KVL B19-01 and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum WJB, were added to wheat bran feed with and without dried egg white, as an additional protein source, directly from neonate larval hatching until reaching a body mass of 20 mg. Subsequently, larvae from the various diets were exposed for 72 h to B. thuringiensis, M. brunneum, or their combination. Larval survival and growth were recorded for 14 days, and the bacterial microbiota composition was analyzed using 16S rDNA sequencing prior to pathogen exposure and on days 3 and 11 after inoculation with the pathogens. The results showed increased survival for T. molitor larvae reared on feed supplemented with P. pentosaceus in the case of co-infection. Larval growth was also impacted in the co-infection treatment. No significant impact of egg white or of P. pentosaceus on larval growth was recorded, while the addition of Lb. plantarum resulted in a minor increase in individual mass gain compared with infected larvae without the latter probiotic. On day 14, B. thuringiensis was no longer detected and the overall bacterial community composition of the larvae was similar in all treatments. On the other hand, the relative operational taxonomic unit (OTU) abundance was dependent on day, diet, and probiotic. Interestingly, P. pentosaceus was present throughout the experiments, while Lb. plantarum was not found at a detectable level, although its transient presence slightly improved larval performance. Overall, this study confirms the potential benefits of some probiotics during the development of T. molitor while underlining the complexity of the relationship between the host and its microbiome.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
174,2024,Marine Microbiota Responses to Shipping Scrubber Effluent Assessed at Community Structure and Function Endpoints,"The use of novel high‐throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies to examine the responses of natural multidomain microbial communities to scrubber effluent discharges to the marine environment is still limited. Thus, we applied metabarcoding sequencing targeting the planktonic unicellular eukaryotic and prokaryotic fraction (phytoplankton, bacterioplankton, and protozooplankton) in mesocosm experiments with natural microbial communities from a polluted and an unpolluted site. Furthermore, metagenomic analysis revealed changes in the taxonomic and functional dominance of multidomain marine microbial communities after scrubber effluent additions. The results indicated a clear shift in the microbial communities after such additions, which favored bacterial taxa with known oil and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) biodegradation capacities. These bacteria exhibited high connectedness with planktonic unicellular eukaryotes employing variable trophic strategies, suggesting that environmentally relevant bacteria can influence eukaryotic community structure. Furthermore, Clusters of Orthologous Genes associated with pathways of PAHs and monocyclic hydrocarbon degradation increased in numbers at treatments with high scrubber effluent additions acutely. These genes are known to express enzymes acting at various substrates including PAHs. These indications, in combination with the abrupt decrease in the most abundant PAHs in the scrubber effluent below the limit of detection—much faster than their known half‐lives—could point toward a bacterioplankton‐initiated rapid ultimate biodegradation of the most abundant toxic contaminants of the scrubber effluent. The implementation of HTS could be a valuable tool to develop multilevel biodiversity indicators of the scrubber effluent impacts on the marine environment, which could lead to improved impact assessment.

175,2024,The microbial community of coral reefs: biofilm composition on artificial substrates under different environmental conditions,"Artificial reefs are used as tools for the restoration of degrading coral reefs by providing new settlement substrates. The initial recruitment process consists of the formation of microbial biofilms shortly after deployment. The aim of the present study is to compare biofilm composition and development on artificial substrates at two different coral-reef sites. These locations differ in their environmental conditions, including their level of anthropogenic impact. Substrate and seawater samples were collected four times during the first 6 months after deployment, using a new methodology termed ‘tab-by-tab’. DNA was extracted, sequenced, and sorted for both prokaryotic (16s) and eukaryotic (18s) genes. No difference was found between the planktonic communities in the water, yet significant differences were observed in the biofilm communities on the structures at the two sites. Moreover, differences were recorded in coral recruitment rates, which are known to be affected by biofilm composition. Our findings suggest a potential role of environmental conditions in the early biofilm stages (first few months), which in turn may impact the succession and development of coral-reef communities and the success of artificial reefs as restoration tools.","Bacteria, Eukaryote, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
176,2024,Anthropogenic contamination sources drive differences in antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli in three urban lakes,"ABSTRACT Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an ever-present threat to the treatment of infectious diseases. However, the potential relevance of this phenomenon in environmental reservoirs still raises many questions. Detection of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in the environment is a critical aspect for understanding the prevalence of resistance outside of clinical settings, as detection in the environment indicates that resistance is likely already widespread. We isolated antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli from three urban waterbodies over a 15-month time series, determined their antimicrobial susceptibilities, investigated their population structure, and identified genetic determinants of resistance. We found that E. coli populations at each site were composed of different dominant phylotypes and showed distinct patterns of antimicrobial and multidrug resistance, despite close geographic proximity. Many strains that were genome-sequenced belonged to sequence types of international concern, particularly the ST131 clonal complex. We found widespread resistance to clinically important antimicrobials such as amoxicillin, cefotaxime, and ciprofloxacin, but found that all strains were susceptible to amikacin and the last-line antimicrobials meropenem and fosfomycin. Resistance was most often due to acquirable antimicrobial resistance genes, while chromosomal mutations in gyrA, parC, and parE conferred resistance to quinolones. Whole-genome analysis of a subset of strains further revealed the diversity of the population of E. coli present, with a wide array of AMR and virulence genes identified, many of which were present on the chromosome, including blaCTX-M. Finally, we determined that environmental persistence, transmission between sites, most likely mediated by wild birds, and transfer of mobile genetic elements likely contributed significantly to the patterns observed. IMPORTANCE A One Health perspective is crucial to understand the extent of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) globally, and investigation of AMR in the environment has been increasing in recent years. However, most studies have focused on waterways that are directly polluted by sewage, industrial manufacturing, or agricultural activities. Therefore, there remains a lack of knowledge about more natural, less overtly impacted environments. Through phenotypic and genotypic investigation of AMR in Escherichia coli, this study adds to our understanding of the extent and patterns of resistance in these types of environments, including over a time series, and showed that complex biotic and abiotic factors contribute to the patterns observed. Our study further emphasizes the importance of incorporating the surveillance of microbes in freshwater environments in order to better comprehend potential risks for both human and animal health and how the environment may serve as a sentinel for potential future clinical infections.

177,2024,Intestinal Dysbiosis in Subjects with Obesity from Western Mexico and Its Association with a Proinflammatory Profile and Disturbances of Folate (B9) and Carbohydrate Metabolism,"Obesity is a public health problem with a growing prevalence worldwide. In Mexico, it is estimated that one out of three adults suffer from obesity. In these patients, the intestinal microbiota (IM) undergoes pathological changes that are associated with a dysbiotic state; however, the microbiota profile of adult subjects with obesity from western Mexico has not been described. To assess this, fecal samples were obtained from 65 participants (Obese = 38; Control = 27). The microbial composition was characterized by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The IM of the group with obesity revealed a clear decrease in richness and diversity (p < 0.001), as well as a significant increase in proinflammatory bacterial groups, mainly genera belonging to the Negativicutes class, Escherichia/Shigella, and Prevotella. Likewise, an increase in short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria was found, especially the genus Lachnoclostridium. Additionally, PICRUSt2 analysis showed a depletion of vitamin B9 metabolism and an increase in saccharolytic pathways. The IM of patients with obesity possesses a dysbiotic, proinflammatory environment, possibly contributing to lipogenesis and adiposity. Thus, assessing the IM will allow for a better understanding of the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases of high prevalence, such as obesity. These findings are described for the first time in the adult population of western Mexico.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
178,2024,The gut microbiomes of Channel Island foxes and island spotted skunks exhibit fine‐scale differentiation across host species and island populations,"Abstract California's Channel Islands are home to two endemic mammalian carnivores: island foxes (Urocyon littoralis) and island spotted skunks (Spilogale gracilis amphiala). Although it is rare for two insular terrestrial carnivores to coexist, these known competitors persist on both Santa Cruz Island and Santa Rosa Island. We hypothesized that examination of their gut microbial communities would provide insight into the factors that enable this coexistence, as microbial symbionts often reflect host evolutionary history and contemporary ecology. Using rectal swabs collected from island foxes and island spotted skunks sampled across both islands, we generated 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data to characterize their gut microbiomes. While island foxes and island spotted skunks both harbored the core mammalian microbiome, host species explained the largest proportion of variation in the dataset. We further identified intraspecific variation between island populations, with greater differentiation observed between more specialist island spotted skunk populations compared to more generalist island fox populations. This pattern may reflect differences in resource utilization following fine‐scale niche differentiation. It may further reflect evolutionary differences regarding the timing of intraspecific separation. Considered together, this study contributes to the growing catalog of wildlife microbiome studies, with important implications for understanding how eco‐evolutionary processes enable the coexistence of terrestrial carnivores–and their microbiomes–in island environments.",Microbiome,Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
179,2024,"A 14-Day Double-Blind, Randomized, Controlled Crossover Intervention Study with Anti-Bacterial Benzyl Isothiocyanate from Nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus) on Human Gut Microbiome and Host Defense","Despite substantial heterogeneity of studies, there is evidence that antibiotics commonly used in primary care influence the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota in terms of changing their composition and/or diversity. Benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) from the food and medicinal plant nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus) is known for its antimicrobial activity and is used for the treatment of infections of the draining urinary tract and upper respiratory tract. Against this background, we raised the question of whether a 14 d nasturtium intervention (3 g daily, N = 30 healthy females) could also impact the normal gut microbiota composition. Spot urinary BITC excretion highly correlated with a weak but significant antibacterial effect against Escherichia coli. A significant increase in human beta defensin 1 as a parameter for host defense was seen in urine and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) upon verum intervention. Pre-to-post analysis revealed that mean gut microbiome composition did not significantly differ between groups, nor did the circulating serum metabolome. On an individual level, some large changes were observed between sampling points, however. Explorative Spearman rank correlation analysis in subgroups revealed associations between gut microbiota and the circulating metabolome, as well as between changes in blood markers and bacterial gut species.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR",Metabolomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
180,2024,First detection of a cefiderocol-resistant and extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolate in Bulgaria.,"Cefiderocol (CFDC) is a first-in-class siderophore cephalosporin with potent activity against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria including carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. The present study aimed to explore the CFDC resistance mechanisms of an extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii isolate from Bulgaria. The A. baumannii Aba52 strain (designated Aba52) was obtained in 2018 from a blood sample of a critically ill patient. The methodology included antimicrobial susceptibility testing, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), multilocus sequence typing, and phylogenomic analysis. The isolate demonstrated high-level resistance to CFDC (MIC = 64 mg L-1), resistance to carbapenems, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and tigecycline, as well as susceptibility only to colistin. WGS-based resistome analysis revealed the existence of blaOXA-23, blaOXA-66 and blaADC-73. Seven non-conservative missense mutations affecting iron transport-related genes were detected: exbD4 (p.Ser61Pro), tonB2 (p.Ala268Val), bauA (p.Thr61Ala), ftsI (p.Ala515Val), piuA (p.Gly216Val), and feoB (p.Ser429Pro and p.Thr595Ala). A variety of virulence factors associated with adherence, biofilm formation, enzyme production, immune invasion, iron uptake, quorum sensing, and two-component regulatory systems were identified, suggesting a significant pathogenic potential of Aba52. The performed RT-qPCR analysis showed diminished (0.17) and absent expression of the pirA and piuA genes, respectively, encoding TonB-dependent siderophore receptors. Aba52 belonged to the widespread high-risk sequence type ST2 (Pasteur scheme). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented case of CFDC-resistant A. baumannii in Bulgaria even though, CFDC has never been applied in our country. The emerging resistance highlights the crucial need for nationwide surveillance targeting the implementation of novel antibiotics.","Bacteria, Pathogen","Isolate, AMR, (M)LST",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
181,2024,Salmon louse labial gland enzymes: implications for host settlement and immune modulation,"Salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) is a skin- and blood-feeding ectoparasite, infesting salmonids. While feeding, labial gland proteins from the salmon louse may be deposited on the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) skin. Previously characterized labial gland proteins are involved in anti-coagulation and may contribute to inhibiting Atlantic salmon from mounting a sufficient immune response against the ectoparasite. As labial gland proteins seem to be important in the host–parasite interaction, we have, therefore, identified and characterized ten enzymes localized to the labial gland. They are a large group of astacins named L. salmonis labial gland astacin 1–8 (LsLGA 1–8), one serine protease named L. salmonis labial gland serine protease 1 (LsLGSP1), and one apyrase named L. salmonis labial gland apyrase 1 (LsLGAp1). Protein domain predictions showed that LsLGA proteins all have N-terminal ShK domains, which may bind to potassium channels targeting the astacins to its substrate. LsLGA1 and -4 are, in addition, expressed in another gland type, whose secrete also meets the host–parasite interface. This suggests that LsLGA proteins may have an anti-microbial function and may prevent secondary infections in the wounds. LsLGAp1 is predicted to hydrolyze ATP or AMP and is, thereby, suggested to have an immune dampening function. In a knockdown study targeting LsLGSP1, a significant increase in IL-8 and MMP13 at the skin infestation site was seen under LsLGSP1 knockdown salmon louse compared to the control, suggesting that LsLGSP1 may have an anti-inflammatory effect. Moreover, most of the identified labial gland proteins are expressed in mature copepodids prior to host settlement, are not regulated by starvation, and are expressed at similar or higher levels in lice infesting the salmon louse-resistant pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha). This study, thereby, emphasizes the importance of labial gland proteins for host settlement and their immune dampening function. This work can further contribute to anti-salmon louse treatment such as vaccine development, functional feed, or gene-edited salmon louse-resistant Atlantic salmon.",,"Functional analysis, Interactome, AMR",,Health & Disease
182,2024,Genetic mutation in Escherichia coli genome during adaptation to the murine intestine is optimized for the host diet,"ABSTRACT Mammalian gut microbes colonize the intestinal tract of their host and adapt to establish a microbial ecosystem. The host diet changes the nutrient profile of the intestine and has a high impact on microbiota composition. Genetic mutations in Escherichia coli, a prevalent species in the human gut, allow for adaptation to the mammalian intestine, as reported in previous studies. However, the extent of colonization fitness in the intestine elevated by genetic mutation and the effects of diet change on these mutations in E. coli are still poorly known. Here, we show that notable mutations in sugar metabolism-related genes (gatC, araC, and malI) were detected in the E. coli K-12 genome just 2 weeks after colonization in the germ-free mouse intestine. In addition to elevated fitness by deletion of gatC, as previously reported, deletion of araC and malI also elevated E. coli fitness in the murine intestine in a host diet-dependent manner. In vitro cultures of medium containing nutrients abundant in the intestine (e.g., galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, and asparagine) also showed increased E. coli fitness after deletion of the genes-of-interest associated with their metabolism. Furthermore, the host diet was found to influence the developmental trajectory of gene mutations in E. coli. Taken together, we suggest that genetic mutations in E. coli are selected in response to the intestinal environment, which facilitates efficient utilization of nutrients abundant in the intestine under laboratory conditions. Our study offers some insight into the possible adaptation mechanisms of gut microbes. IMPORTANCE The gut microbiota is closely associated with human health and is greatly impacted by the host diet. Bacteria such as Escherichia coli live in the gut all throughout the life of a human host and adapt to the intestinal environment. Adaptive mutations in E. coli are reported to enhance fitness in the mammalian intestine, but to what extent is still poorly known. It is also unknown whether the host diet affects what genes are mutated and to what extent fitness is affected. This study suggests that genetic mutations in the E. coli K-12 strain are selected in response to the intestinal environment and facilitate efficient utilization of abundant nutrients in the germ-free mouse intestine. Our study provides a better understanding of these intestinal adaptation mechanisms of gut microbes.

183,2024,Staurosporine-producing Streptomyces sp. strain 11 × 1 cell-free culture filtrates control diseases caused by the oomycete plant pathogens Pythium myriotylum and Phytophthora sojae,"ABSTRACT Oomycetes are devastating soil-borne plant pathogens, and cause numerous losses on diverse crops worldwide. In this study, our aim was to identify actinomycetes with antimicrobial activity towards oomycetes from the rhizosphere of soybean. Strong growth inhibition of P. myriotylum was found in dual culture with a strain called 11 × 1, and also from using the 11 × 1 cell-free culture filtrate and EtOAc extract. The P. myriotylum growth-inhibiting activity of the 11 × 1 culture filtrates was stable at high temperatures, and acidic and alkaline conditions. The 11 × 1 strain was identified as a Streptomyces strain with the highest 16S rDNA sequence identity to S. scabiei, and phylogenomic analysis also showed clustering with S. scabiei strains. Applying the 11 × 1 culture filtrates to ginger and soybean leaves inhibited the necrosis caused by P. myriotylum and P. sojae, respectively. Pot assay experiments showed a strong control effect of the 11 × 1 culture filtrate against P. myriotylum-caused soft-rot disease of ginger, and against P. sojae caused root-rot of soybean. Analysis of the biosynthetic gene clusters from the genome of 11 × 1 predicted the production of staurosporine, and staurosporine was subsequently identified from LC-MS analysis of the 11 × 1 extract. The concentrations of staurosporine quantified in the 11 × 1 extracts were in the range of the staurosporine minimum inhibitory concentrations for P. myriotylum, supporting the contribution of staurosporine to the biocontrol effect of 11 × 1. The use of 11 × 1 culture filtrate to control both ginger and soybean diseases could be beneficial in an intercropping system of ginger and the leguminous nitrogen-fixing soybean.",Pathogen,AMR,"Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

Within the first two weeks of life, there is a risk for a foal to suffer from diarrhea, particularly “foal heat diarrhea” which happens at about the time of a mare’s estrus cycle but is more likely due to transitions in the microbiota in the foal’s gastrointestinal (GI) tract. We hypothesized that this GI microbiota transition could be caused by changes in lysozyme and microbial populations in the mare’s milk. To test this hypothesis, fifteen mare-foal pairs were followed in the first 15 days post-foaling. Every other day milk was collected from mares and rectal swabs were collected from foals. Lysozyme activity in the mare’s milk was measured using a fluorescence assay. Microbial DNA was isolated from the milk and swabs and the V4 domain of 16 S rRNA genes were PCR amplified and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq technology. Microbial populations were analyzed using DADA2 and phyloseq within R . Results Mare’s milk lysozyme activity peaked for samples at Day 1 and levels dropped to 72.5% of Day 1 activity by Day 15; however, microbial populations in the mare’s milk did not vary significantly over the two weeks. Furthermore, levels of microbial diversity found in foal rectal swabs were initially similar to microbial diversity seen in mare’s milk; however, over the first fifteen days, diversity increased for the foal rectal swab microbiota and swab microbial populations differed from milk microbes. A transition occurred shifting from microbes from the phylum Proteobacteria early in rectal swabs to those primarily from the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidota after the first few days post-foaling. These phyla contained several families and genera of microbes that promote utilization of milk components in healthy gut transition. Microbial abundance levels correlated more with days post-parturition than with lysozyme activity and mare’s milk microbial populations. Conclusions The findings suggest that much of the microbial populations responsible for the transition of the foal’s gut comes from sources outside of mare’s milk species and levels of lysozyme activity.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling",,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
185,2024,"Antibiotic resistance, plasmids, and virulence-associated markers in human strains of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli isolated in Italy","Campylobacteriosis, a prevalent foodborne gastrointestinal infection in Europe, is primarily caused by Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli, with rising global concerns over antimicrobial resistance in these species. This study comprehensively investigates 133 human-origin Campylobacter spp. strains (102 C. jejuni and 31 C. coli) collected in Italy from 2013 to 2021. The predominant Multilocus Sequence Typing Clonal complexes (CCs) were ST-21 CC and ST-206 CC in C. jejuni and ST-828 CC in C. coli. Ciprofloxacin and tetracycline resistance, mainly attributed to GyrA (T86I) mutation and tet(O) presence, were prevalent, while erythromycin resistance was associated with 23S rRNA gene mutation (A2075G), particularly in C. coli exhibiting multidrug-resistant pattern CipTE. Notable disparities in virulence factors among strains were observed, with C. jejuni exhibiting a higher abundance compared to C. coli. Notably, specific C. jejuni sequence types, including ST-21, ST-5018, and ST-1263, demonstrated significantly elevated counts of virulence genes. This finding underscores the significance of considering both the species and strain-level variations in virulence factor profiles, shedding light on potential differences in the pathogenicity and clinical outcomes associated with distinct C. jejuni lineages. Campylobacter spp. plasmids were classified into three groups comprising pVir-like and pTet-like plasmids families, exhibiting diversity among Campylobacter spp. The study underscores the importance of early detection through Whole Genome Sequencing to identify potential emergent virulence, resistance/virulence plasmids, and new antimicrobial resistance markers. This approach provides actionable public health data, supporting the development of robust surveillance programs in Italy.","Bacteria, Pathogen","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR, (M)LST",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
186,2024,Nonkin interactions between Bacillus subtilis soil isolates limit the spread of swarming deficient cheats,"Abstract Cooperative behaviours in human, animal, and even microbial societies are vulnerable to exploitation. Kin discrimination has been hypothesized to help stabilize cooperation. However, the mechanisms that sustain cooperative behaviour remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of kin discrimination in limiting the spread of cheats in adjoining populations during surfactant-dependent cooperative swarming over surfaces using the bacterium Bacillus subtilis as a model organism. We show that mixing surfactant secreting cooperators and cheats that do not produce surfactants at 1:1 initial ratio quickly leads to cooperation collapse. However, when such common swarms encounter nonkin B. subtilis swarms, the proportion of the surfactant nonproducers decreases, suggesting that kinship dependent interactions may limit cheats’ advantage in an adjoining population. To further validate this finding, we subjected wild-type cooperators to multiple transient encounters with kin and nonkin swarms over 20 cycles of experimental evolution. The evolved populations exposed to nonkin swarms less frequently contained defective swarming phenotypes compared to those encountering kin swarms. Altogether, our results support the prediction that the spread of cheats in an adjoining bacterial population is impeded by kin discrimination interactions, which might have a role in stabilizing cooperative behaviour in evolving populations.",Bacteria,"Isolate, Interactome",,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
187,2024,"Changes in the Microbial Community Associated with the Large Benthic Foraminifera Cycloclypeus Carpenteri, Along a Depth Gradient","
 Cycloclypeus carpenteri is one of the deepest living large benthic foraminifera. It has an obligatory relationship with diatom photosymbionts, and, in addition, houses a diverse prokaryotic community. Variations in the eukaryotic and prokaryotic endobiotic community composition might be key in allowing Cycloclypeus to occur in low light environments. We assessed the variability of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities associated with Cycloclypeus along a depth gradient from 50 to 130 m at two locations in the Federated States of Micronesia (Northwest Pacific) by metabarcoding of the 18S V9 rRNA region for eukaryotes and the 16S V3-V4 rRNA region for prokaryotes. We observed a single foraminiferal operational taxonomic unit (OTU), as well as a single dominant diatom OTU that was abundant in all sequenced specimens. Both the prokaryotic and the eukaryotic endobiotic communities (excluding the dominant diatom) changed with water depth and associated irradiance levels. We observed a distinct change in the prokaryotic community composition around 90–100 m water depth at Pohnpei, equivalent to ∼1% surface radiation. This change in microbial communities in the Cycloclypeus holobiont suggests a potential role of the associated microbial communities in accommodating differences in (micro)habitat, although we cannot exclude that the prokaryote community is to a large extent driven by their community composition in the ambient environment.","Bacteria, Eukaryote, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
188,2023,Succession of the bacterial community from a spacecraft assembly clean room when enriched in brines relevant to Mars,"Abstract Interplanetary spacecraft are built in a spacecraft assembly facility (SAF), a clean room designed to reduce microbial contamination that could confound life detection missions or influence native ecosystems. The frigid hyperarid near-surface environment of Mars has ample hygroscopic Mg and Na salts of chloride, (per)chlorate and sulphate that may deliquesce to form dense brines, liquids with low water activity, and freezing points <0°C. The current study sought to define the climax microbial community after 6 mo of enrichment of SAF floor wipe samples in salt plains medium supplemented with 50% (w/v; ~2 M; aw = 0.94) MgSO4 or 20% (w/v; ~1.9 M; aw = 0.91) NaClO3. After 1 wk, 4 wk and 6 mo of incubation, metagenomic DNA extracts of the enriched SAF microbial community were used for high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and subsequent phylogenetic analyses. Additionally, dozens of bacterial strains were isolated by repetitive streak-plating from the climax community after 6 mo of enrichment. Early in the enrichment, staphylococci greatly dominated and then remained abundant members of the community. However, actinobacteria succeeded the staphylococci as the dominant taxa as the cultures matured, including Arthrobacter, Brachybacterium and Brevibacterium. A diverse assemblage of bacilli was present, with Oceanobacillus being especially abundant. The SAF culture collection included representatives of Brachybacterium conglomeratum, Brevibacterium sediminis, Oceanobacillus picturae and Staphylococcus sciuri. These were characterized with biochemical and physiological tests, revealing their high salinotolerance. Shannon diversity indices were generally near 2, reflecting modest diversity at several levels of identity and the community structures were uneven throughout. However, minor members of the community seem capable of the ecosystem functions required for biogeochemical cycling. For instance, organisms capable of all the functions of the N cycle were detected. The microbial assemblage in SAFs is the most likely to be transported by spacecraft to another world. While individual microbial populations may exhibit the qualities needed for survival at the near-surface of Mars, certainly entire communities with the capacity for complete biogeochemical cycling, would have a greater chance of survival and proliferation.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, MAGs","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
189,2023,Influence of three different manure treatments on antimicrobial resistance genes and mobile genetic elements,"There is a growing concern about the potential dissemination of antimicrobial resistance into agricultural fields due to the application of manure as crop fertilizer. While reducing the usage of antibiotics in livestock production stands as the first alternative to prevent this problem, there is evidence that this may not be enough to eliminate antimicrobial resistance elements already present in manure microbiomes. This study employed a metagenomic approach to investigate the impact of common manure treatments, including aerobic storage, mesophilic anaerobic digestion (MAD), and solid-liquid separation, on the presence and abundance of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), bactericides, and heavy metal resistance genes (BacMet), and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in manure from three different farms, including one operating in an antibiotic-free environment. The results indicated that MAD was the best method to reduce the numbers of ARGs, BacMet, and MGEs, achieving reduction rates greater than 40%, 89%, and 68%, respectively. Manure storage significantly reduced BacMet levels (over 30%) and MGEs (28%) but had no significant effect on total ARG levels. Solids recovered through solid-liquid separation exhibited elevated levels of ARGs, BacMet, and MGEs, while the liquid fraction displayed levels similar to untreated manures. Correlation and co-occurrence modeling analyses indicated that changes in microbial communities, particularly fluctuations in aerobic and facultative communities belonging to Bacillota, Actinomycetota, and Pseudomonadota phyla, played a significant role in driving changes in ARGs, BacMet, and MGEs. The results also showed the presence of toxin-antitoxin and transposon systems near different ARGs. Overall, the results confirmed that genes conferring resistance to various antimicrobials and MGE capable of mobilizing them are widely spread in dairy farms; that even under the absence of antibiotics, the use of heavy metals and disinfectants may promote the maintenance of ARGs and MGEs, and; that treatment such as anaerobic digestion could reduce the risk of the spread of antimicrobial resistance.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

SBS causes profound alterations in the intestinal microbiome and metabolome. The aim of this study was a detailed assessment of the intestinal microbiome and metabolome in a murine model of SBS. We performed a 60% proximal small bowel resection versus a sham operation in C57BL/6 mice. Four weeks postoperatively, the microbial communities of different intestinal segments (jejunum, ileum, colon) and stool were assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Bile acids in serum and stool and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the fecal headspace were assessed using LC-MS and GC-MS techniques. The α-diversity of the different intestinal segments did not significantly differ between the two groups. β-diversity significantly differed between sham and SBS mice. While in the jejunum, Faecalibaculum was significantly increased in SBS animals, a significant reduction in Lactobacillus and Sporosarcina was detected in the ileum of SBS mice. In the colon of SBS mice, a significant decrease in Ruminococcaceae and a significant increase in Proteobacteria such as Faecalibaculum and Escherichia-Shigella were found. Serum levels of deoxycholic, taurocholic and taurochenodeoxycholic acids were significantly higher in the SBS group. Of the 29 VOCs tested, hexane, isoflurane and pentane were significantly higher in the SBS group, and pyrrole was significantly lower. We were able to show that SBS causes shifts in the murine intestinal microbiome and metabolome including serum BAs and fecal VOCs.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Gene identification / Biomarker","Metabarcoding, Metabolomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
192,2023,Selective cell lysis pressure on rare and abundant prokaryotic taxa across a shelf-to-slope continuum in the Northern South China Sea,"ABSTRACT Microbial growth and mortality are fundamental to community assembly and drive the elemental biogeochemical cycles in the ocean. Virus-induced host lysis contributes, on average, half of prokaryotic mortality and has a substantial effect on composition and diversity of marine microbes. Nevertheless, virus-mediated taxon-specific cell lysis is few studied to date. In the present study, we investigated the taxon-specific cell lysis and estimated its contribution to the variations of community composition in rare and abundant microbial taxa. The dominant taxa Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, SAR11, and Rhodobacteraceae displayed lower cell lysis index (CLI, the rate of extracellular to intracellular rRNA) in surface seawater. Meanwhile, Alteromonas, Pseudomonas, and Halomonas had high CLI values in the bottom seawater. Cell lysis contributed a larger percentage of variation in rare taxa (5.0%–9.4%) than in abundant taxa (0.1%–1.7%). Furthermore, linear regression analysis indicated that rare taxa were more likely to experience higher viral lysis pressure relative to abundant taxa. Our findings provide insight into the impact of virus-mediated cell lysis on prokaryotic community structure and diversity and further improve our understanding of the various abiotic and biotic factors contributing to community assembly in the ocean. IMPORTANCE Virus-induced host lysis contributes up to 40% of total prokaryotic mortality and plays crucial roles in shaping microbial composition and diversity in the ocean. Nonetheless, what taxon-specific cell lysis is caused by viruses remains to be studied. The present study, therefore, examined the taxon-specific cell lysis and estimated its contribution to the variations in the rare and abundant microbial taxa. The results demonstrate that taxon-specific mortality differed in surface and bottom of the coastal environment. In addition, active rare taxa are more susceptible to heightened lytic pressure and suggested the importance of viral lysis in regulating the microbial community composition. These results improve our understanding of bottom-up (abiotic environmental variables) and top-down (viral lysis) controls contributing to microbial community assembly in the ocean.

193,2023,Transcriptional Response of Candida albicans to Nanostructured Surfaces Provides Insight into Cellular Rupture and Antifungal Drug Sensitization,"The rise in resistance levels against antifungal drugs has necessitated the development of strategies to combat fungal infections. Nanoscale antimicrobial surfaces, found on the cuticles of insects, have recently emerged as intriguing alternative antifungal strategies that function passively via contact and induced cell rupture. Nanostructured surfaces (NSS) offer a potentially transformative antimicrobial approach to reducing microbial biofilm formation. We examined the transcriptional response of Candida albicans, an opportunistic pathogen that is also a commensal dimorphic fungus, to the NSS found in the wings of Neotibicen spp. cicada and found characteristic changes in the expression of C. albicans genes associated with metabolism, biofilm formation, ergosterol biosynthesis, and DNA damage response after 2 h of exposure to the NSS. Further validation revealed that these transcriptional changes, particularly in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, sensitize C. albicans to major classes of antifungal drugs. These findings provide insights into NSS as antimicrobial surfaces and as a means of controlling biofilm formation.",Pathogen,"Functional analysis, AMR",,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
194,2023,"Increased fecal ethanol and enriched ethanol-producing gut bacteria Limosilactobacillus fermentum, Enterocloster bolteae, Mediterraneibacter gnavus and Streptococcus mutans in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis","Background Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has become a major public health issue as one of the leading causes of liver disease and transplantation worldwide. The instrumental role of the gut microbiota is emerging but still under investigation. Endogenous ethanol (EtOH) production by gut bacteria and yeasts is an emerging putative mechanism. Microbial metagenomics and culture studies targeting enterobacteria or yeasts have been reported, but no culturomics studies have been conducted so far. Aim To assess fecal EtOH and other biochemical parameters, characterize NASH-associated dysbiosis and identify EtOH-producing gut microbes associated with the disease, fecal samples from 41 NASH patients and 24 controls were analyzed. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used for EtOH, glucose, total proteins, triglyceride and total cholesterol. Viable bacteria were assessed with microbial culturomics. Microbial genetic material was assessed using 16S metagenomics targeting the hypervariable V3V4 region. Results Fecal EtOH and glucose was elevated in the stools of NASH patients (p < 0.05) but not triglyceride, total cholesterol or proteins. In culturomics, EtOH-producing Enterocloster bolteae and Limosilactobacillus fermentum were enriched in NASH. V3V4 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing confirmed the enrichment in EtOH-producing bacteria including L. fermentum, Mediterraneibacter gnavus and Streptococcus mutans, species previously associated with NASH and other dysbiosis-associated diseases. Strikingly, E. bolteae was identified only by culturomics. The well-known Lacticaseibacillus casei was identified in controls but never isolated in patients with NASH (p < 0.05). Conclusion Elevated fecal EtOH and glucose is a feature of NASH. Several different EtOH-producing gut bacteria may play an instrumental role in the disease. Culturomics and metagenomics, two complementary methods, will be critical to identify EtOH-producing bacteria for future diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for NASH. Suppression of EtOH-producing gut microbes and L. casei administration are options to be tested in NASH treatment.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Isolate,"Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
195,2023,New sensitive tools to characterize meta-metabolome response to short- and long-term cobalt exposure in dynamic river biofilm communities,"Untargeted metabolomics is a non-a priori analysis of biomolecules that characterizes the metabolome variations induced by short- and long-term exposures to stressors. Even if the metabolite annotation remains lacunar due to database gaps, the global metabolomic fingerprint allows for trend analyses of dose-response curves for hundreds of cellular metabolites. The combination of untargeted metabolomic features and benchmark-dose (BMD) calculations then makes it possible to determine concentration range inducing defense responses (CRIDeR) and concentration range inducing damage responses (CRIDaR). To develop this approach in a context of time-dependent microbial community changes, mature river biofilms were exposed for 1 month to four cobalt (Co) concentrations (background concentration, 1 x 10-7, 5 x 10-7 and 1 x 10- 6 M) in an open system of artificial streams. The meta-metabolomic response of biofilms was compared against a multitude of biological parameters (including bioaccumulation, biomass, chlorophyll a content, composition and structure of prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities) monitored at set exposure times (from 1 hour to 28 days). Cobalt exposure induced extremely rapid responses of the meta-metabolome, with time range inducing defense responses (TRIDeR) of around ten seconds, and time range inducing damage responses (TRIDaR) of several hours. Even in biofilms whose structure had been altered by Co bioaccumulation (reduced biomass, chlorophyll a contents and changes in the composition and diversity of prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities), CRIDeRs with similar initiation thresholds (1.41 ± 0.77 x 10-10 M Co2+ added in the exposure medium) were set up at the meta-metabolome level at every time point. In contrast, the CRIDaR initiation thresholds increased by 10 times in long-term Co exposed biofilms. The present study demonstrates that defense and damage responses of biofilm meta-metabolome exposed to Co are rapidly and sustainably impacted, even within tolerant and resistant microbial communities. Graphical abstract Highlights Prokaryotic community structures were impacted after 1 h of exposure to Co Biofilm meta-metabolome was impacted after 36 s of exposure to Co Biofilm meta-metabolome response was faster than changes in biofilm communities Short- and long-term exposed biofilms have similar CRIDeR initiation thresholds Long-term exposed biofilms have higher CRIDaR initiation thresholds","Bacteria, Eukaryote, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR, Annotation",Metabolomics,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
196,2023,The Archaeome’s Role in Colorectal Cancer: Unveiling the DPANN Group and Investigating Archaeal Functional Signatures,"Background and Aims: Gut microbial imbalances are linked to colorectal cancer (CRC), but archaea’s role remains underexplored. Here, using previously published metagenomic data from different populations including Austria, Germany, Italy, Japan, China, and India, we performed bioinformatic and statistical analysis to identify archaeal taxonomic and functional signatures related to CRC. Methods: We analyzed published fecal metagenomic data from 390 subjects, comparing the archaeomes of CRC and healthy individuals. We conducted a biostatistical analysis to investigate the relationship between Candidatus Mancarchaeum acidiphilum (DPANN superphylum) and other archaeal species associated with CRC. Using the Prokka tool, we annotated the data focusing on archaeal genes, subsequently linking them to CRC and mapping them against UniprotKB and GO databases for specific archaeal gene functions. Results: Our analysis identified enrichment of methanogenic archaea in healthy subjects, with an exception for Methanobrevibacter smithii, which correlated with CRC. Notably, CRC showed a strong association with archaeal species, particularly Natrinema sp. J7-2, Ferroglobus placidus, and Candidatus Mancarchaeum acidiphilum. Furthermore, the DPANN archaeon exhibited a significant correlation with other CRC-associated archaea (p < 0.001). Functionally, we found a marked association between MvhB-type polyferredoxin and colorectal cancer. We also highlighted the association of archaeal proteins involved in the biosynthesis of leucine and the galactose metabolism process with the healthy phenotype. Conclusions: The archaeomes of CRC patients show identifiable alterations, including a decline in methanogens and an increase in Halobacteria species. MvhB-type polyferredoxin, linked with CRC and species like Candidatus Mancarchaeum acidiphilum, Natrinema sp. J7-2, and Ferroglobus placidus emerge as potential archaeal biomarkers. Archaeal proteins may also offer gut protection, underscoring archaea’s role in CRC dynamics.","Bacteria, Archaea","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Gene identification / Biomarker","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Health & Disease
197,2023,GroEL-Proteotyping of Bacterial Communities Using Tandem Mass Spectrometry,"Profiling bacterial populations in mixed communities is a common task in microbiology. Sequencing of 16S small subunit ribosomal-RNA (16S rRNA) gene amplicons is a widely accepted and functional approach but relies on amplification primers and cannot quantify isotope incorporation. Tandem mass spectrometry proteotyping is an effective alternative for taxonomically profiling microorganisms. We suggest that targeted proteotyping approaches can complement traditional population analyses. Therefore, we describe an approach to assess bacterial community compositions at the family level using the taxonomic marker protein GroEL, which is ubiquitously found in bacteria, except a few obligate intracellular species. We refer to our method as GroEL-proteotyping. GroEL-proteotyping is based on high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry of GroEL peptides and identification of GroEL-derived taxa via a Galaxy workflow and a subsequent Python-based analysis script. Its advantage is that it can be performed with a curated and extendable sample-independent database and that GroEL can be pre-separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to reduce sample complexity, improving GroEL identification while simultaneously decreasing the instrument time. GroEL-proteotyping was validated by employing it on a comprehensive raw dataset obtained through a metaproteome approach from synthetic microbial communities as well as real human gut samples. Our data show that GroEL-proteotyping enables fast and straightforward profiling of highly abundant taxa in bacterial communities at reasonable taxonomic resolution.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis","Metabarcoding, (Meta)proteomics, Metaproteomics",

199,2023,"Evolutionary innovation through transcription factor rewiring in microbes is shaped by levels of transcription factor activity, expression, and existing connectivity","The survival of a population during environmental shifts depends on whether the rate of phenotypic adaptation keeps up with the rate of changing conditions. A common way to achieve this is via change to gene regulatory network (GRN) connections—known as rewiring—that facilitate novel interactions and innovation of transcription factors. To understand the success of rapidly adapting organisms, we therefore need to determine the rules that create and constrain opportunities for GRN rewiring. Here, using an experimental microbial model system with the soil bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens, we reveal a hierarchy among transcription factors that are rewired to rescue lost function, with alternative rewiring pathways only unmasked after the preferred pathway is eliminated. We identify 3 key properties—high activation, high expression, and preexisting low-level affinity for novel target genes—that facilitate transcription factor innovation. Ease of acquiring these properties is constrained by preexisting GRN architecture, which was overcome in our experimental system by both targeted and global network alterations. This work reveals the key properties that determine transcription factor evolvability, and as such, the evolution of GRNs.",Bacteria,"Functional analysis, Interactome",,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

Here, we assemble the first genomic and transcriptomic resources for the recently described southern stuttering frog (Mixophyes australis). The southern stuttering frog is ground-dwelling, inhabiting naturally vegetated riverbanks in south-eastern Australia. Using PacBio HiFi long-read sequencing and Hi-C scaffolding, we generated a high-quality genome assembly, with a scaffold N50 of 369.3 Mb and 95.1% of the genome contained in twelve scaffolds. Using this assembly, we identified the mitochondrial genome, and assembled six tissue-specific transcriptomes. We also bioinformatically characterised novel sequences of two families of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in the southern stuttering frog, the cathelicidins and β-defensins. While traditional peptidomic approaches to peptide discovery have typically identified one or two AMPs in a frog species from skin secretions, our bioinformatic approach discovered 12 cathelicidins and two β-defensins that were expressed in a range of tissues.

Metabolism by microbes markedly affects the quality of cocoa beans fermented and the chocolate produced thereof. The present study characterized the microbiota and their metabolic profiles in temperature- and humidity-controlled intra-factory cocoa fermentation in a semitropical area of Japan. Although environmental factors were uniform, the microbiota of cocoa beans subjected to intra-factory fermentation was not stable between tests, particularly in terms of the cell count levels and species observed. Fermentation was sometimes delayed, and fermenting microbes were present at very low levels after 24 hr of fermentation. Due to the unstable microbiota, the profiles of water-soluble compounds differed between tests, indicating the unstable qualities of the fermented cocoa beans. These results suggest the necessity of starter cultures not only in on-farm fermentation but also in machine-controlled intra-factory cocoa fermentation.",Microbiome,,,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

203,2023,The Fate and Functionality of Alien tRNA Fragments in Culturing Medium and Cells of Escherichia coli,"Numerous observations have supported the idea that various types of noncoding RNAs, including tRNA fragments (tRFs), are involved in communications between the host and its microbial community. The possibility of using their signaling function has stimulated the study of secreted RNAs, potentially involved in the interspecies interaction of bacteria. This work aimed at identifying such RNAs and characterizing their maturation during transport. We applied an approach that allowed us to detect oligoribonucleotides secreted by Prevotella copri (Segatella copri) or Rhodospirillum rubrum inside Escherichia coli cells. Four tRFs imported by E. coli cells co-cultured with these bacteria were obtained via chemical synthesis, and all of them affected the growth of E. coli. Their successive modifications in the culture medium and recipient cells were studied by high-throughput cDNA sequencing. Instead of the expected accidental exonucleolysis, in the milieu, we observed nonrandom cleavage by endonucleases continued in recipient cells. We also found intramolecular rearrangements of synthetic oligonucleotides, which may be considered traces of intermediate RNA circular isomerization. Using custom software, we estimated the frequency of such events in transcriptomes and secretomes of E. coli and observed surprising reproducibility in positions of such rare events, assuming the functionality of ring isoforms or their permuted derivatives in bacteria.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome",(Meta)transcriptomics,

In this work, we investigated the interactions in vitro, in planta, and at the molecular level of two elite biological control agents (BCAs), that is Streptomyces microflavus strain AtB‐42 and Trichoderma harzianum strain M10, to understand their attitude to cooperate in a consortium. In vitro, we observed a strong cross‐antagonism between AtB‐42 and M10 in agar plates due to diffusible metabolites and volatile organic compounds. In liquid co‐cultures, M10 hindered the growth of AtB‐42 very likely because of secondary metabolites and strong competition for the nutrients. The interaction in the co‐culture induced extensive transcriptional reprogramming in both strains, especially in the pathways related to ribosomes, protein synthesis, and oxidoreductase activity, suggesting that each strain recognized the counterpart and activated its defence responses. The metabolome of both strains was also significantly affected. In contrast, in the soil, M10 growth was partially contrasted by AtB‐42. The roots of tomato seedlings inoculated with the consortium appeared smaller than the control and single‐strain‐inoculated plants, indicating that plants diverted some energy from the development to defence activation, as evidenced by the leaf transcriptome. The consortium induced a stronger transcriptional change compared to the single inoculants, as demonstrated by a higher number of differentially expressed genes. Although the cross‐antagonism observed in vitro, the two strains exerted a synergistic effect on tomato seedlings by inducing resistance responses stronger than the single inoculants. Our observations pose a question on the usefulness of the sole in vitro assays for selecting BCAs to construct a consortium. In vivo experiments should be preferred, and transcriptomics may greatly help to elucidate the activity of the BCAs beyond the phenotypic effects on the plant.",,"Interactome, AMR","(Meta)transcriptomics, Metabolomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
206,2023,"IRIDA-ARIES Genomics, a key player in the One Health surveillance of diseases caused by infectious agents in Italy","Pathogen genomics is transforming surveillance of infectious diseases, deepening our understanding of evolution and diffusion of etiological agents, host-pathogen interactions and antimicrobial resistance. This discipline is playing an important role in the development of One Health Surveillance with public health experts of various disciplines integrating methods applied to pathogen research, monitoring, management and prevention of outbreaks. Especially with the notion that foodborne diseases may not be transmitted by food only, the ARIES Genomics project aimed to deliver an Information System for the collection of genomic and epidemiological data to enable genomics-based surveillance of infectious epidemics, foodborne outbreaks and diseases at the animal-human interface. Keeping in mind that the users of the system comprised persons with expertise in a wide variety of domains, the system was expected to be used with a low learning curve directly by the persons target of the analyses' results, keeping the information exchange chains as short as possible. As a result, the IRIDA-ARIES platform (https://irida.iss.it/) provides an intuitive web-based interface for multisectoral data collection and bioinformatic analyses. In practice, the user creates a sample and uploads the Next-generation sequencing reads, then an analysis pipeline is launched automatically performing a series of typing and clustering operations fueling the information flow. Instances of IRIDA-ARIES host the Italian national surveillance system for infections by Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) and the surveillance system for infections by Shigatoxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). As of today, the platform does not provide tools to manage epidemiological investigations but serves as an instrument of aggregation for risk monitoring, capable of triggering alarms on possible critical situations that might go unnoticed otherwise.",Pathogen,"Interactome, AMR",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease
207,2023,Fecal Microbial Structure and Metabolic Profile in Post-Weaning Diarrheic Piglets,"(1) Background: Piglet diarrhea is one of the most serious diseases in pigs and has brought great economic losses to the pig industry. Alteration of the gut microbiota is an important factor in the etiology of piglet diarrhea. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the differences in the gut microbial structures and fecal metabolic profile between post-weaning diarrhea and healthy Chinese Wannan Black pigs. (2) Methods: An integrated approach of 16S rRNA gene sequencing combined with LC/MS-based metabolomics was employed in this study. (3) Results: We found an increase in the relative abundance of the bacterial genus Campylobacter and a decrease in phylum Bacteroidetes and the species Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus. (S. macedonicus) in piglet diarrhea. Meanwhile, obvious changes in the fecal metabolic profile of diarrheic piglets were also detected, particularly higher levels of polyamines (spermine and spermidine). Moreover, there were substantial associations between the disturbed gut microbiota and the altered fecal metabolites, especially a strong positive relationship between spermidine and Campylobacter. (4) Conclusions: These observations may provide novel insights into potential etiologies related to post-weaning diarrhea and further enhance our understanding of the role of gut microbiota in host homeostasis and in modulating gut microbial structure.","Bacteria, Microbiome",,"Metabarcoding, Metabolomics",Health & Disease
208,2023,Alterations of the gut microbiota in type 2 diabetics with or without subclinical hypothyroidism,"Background Diabetes and thyroid dysfunction are two closely related endocrine diseases. Increasing evidences show that gut microbiota plays an important role in both glucose metabolism and thyroid homeostasis. Meanwhile, copy number variation (CNV) of host salivary α-amylase gene (AMY1) has been shown to correlate with glucose homeostasis. Hence, we aim to characterize the gut microbiota and CNV of AMY1 in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients with or without subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH). Methods High-throughput sequencing was used to analyze the gut microbiota of euthyroid T2D patients, T2D patients with SCH and healthy controls. Highly sensitive droplet digital PCR was used to measure AMY1 CN. Results Our results revealed that T2D patients have lower gut microbial diversity, no matter with or without SCH. The characteristic taxa of T2D patients were Coriobacteriales, Coriobacteriaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Collinsella, Pseudomonas and Romboutsia. Meanwhile, Escherichia/Shigella, Lactobacillus_Oris, Parabacteroides Distasonis_ATCC_8503, Acetanaerobacterium, Lactonifactor, uncultured bacterium of Acetanaerobacterium were enriched in T2D patients with SCH. Moreover, serum levels of free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4) in T2D patients were both negatively correlated with richness of gut microbiota. A number of specific taxa were also associated with clinical parameters at the phylum and genus level. In contrast, no correlation was found between AMY1 CN and T2D or T2D_SCH. Conclusion This study identified characteristic bacterial taxa in gut microbiota of T2D patients with or without SCH, as well as the taxa associated with clinical indices in T2D patients. These results might be exploited in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of endocrine disorders in the future.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis",,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
209,2023,"A comparison between Greengenes, SILVA, RDP, and NCBI reference databases in four published microbiota datasets","Inaccurate bacterial taxonomic assignment in 16S-based microbiota experiments could have deleterious effects on research results, as all downstream analyses heavily rely on the accurate assessment of microbial taxonomy: a bias in the choice of the reference database can deeply alter microbiota biodiversity (alpha-diversity), composition (beta-diversity), and taxa profile (bacterial relative abundances). In this paper, we explored the influence of the reference 16S rRNA collection by performing a classification against four of the main databases used by the scientific community (i.e. Greengenes, SILVA, RDP, NCBI); the consequences of database clustering at 97% were also explored. To investigate the effects of the database choice on real and representative microbiome samples from different ecosystems, we performed a comparative analysis on four already published datasets from various sources: stools from a mouse model experiment, bovine milk, human gut microbiota stool samples, and swabs from the human vaginal environment. We took into consideration the computational time needed to perform the taxonomic classification as well. Although values in both alpha- and beta-diversity varied a lot, sometimes even statistically, according to the dataset chosen and the eventual clustering, the final outcome of the analysis was a concordance in the capability to retrieve the original experimental group differences over the various datasets. However, in the taxonomy classification, we found several inconsistencies with taxonomies correctly assigned in only some of the four databases. The degree of concordance among the databases was related to both the complexity of the environment and its degree of completeness in the reference databases. IMPORTANCE 16S rRNA sequencing is, nowadays, the most commonly used strategy for microbiota profiling in many different ecosystems, ranging from human-associated to animal models, food matrices, and environmental samples. The ability of this kind of analysis to correctly capture differences in the microbiota composition is related to the taxonomic classification of the fragments obtained from sequencing and, thus, to the choice of the best reference database. This paper deals with four of the most popular microbial databases, which were evaluated in their ability to reproduce the experimental evidence from four already published datasets. The knowledge of the advantages and drawbacks of the database choice can be pivotal for planning future experiments in the field, making researchers aware of the repercussions of such a choice according to the different environments under scrutiny. Moreover, this work can also shed new light upon past results, partially explaining discordant evidence.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Comparative analysis",Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
210,2023,Gut Bacterial Communities in HIV-Infected Individuals with Metabolic Syndrome: Effects of the Therapy with Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor-Based and Protease Inhibitor-Based Regimens,"Antiretroviral therapies (ART) are strongly associated with weight gain and metabolic syndrome (MetS) development in HIV-infected patients. Few studies have evaluated the association between gut microbiota and integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-based and protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimens in HIV-infected patients with MetS. To assess this, fecal samples were obtained from HIV-infected patients treated with different regimens (16 PI + MetS or 30 INSTI + MetS) and 18 healthy controls (HCs). The microbial composition was characterized using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The INSTI-based and PI-based regimens were associated with a significant decrease in α-diversity compared to HCs. The INSTI + MetS group showed the lowest α-diversity between both regimens. A significant increase in the abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing genera (Roseburia, Dorea, Ruminococcus torques, and Coprococcus) was observed in the PI + MetS group, while Prevotella, Fusobacterium, and Succinivibrio were significantly increased in the INSTI + MetS group. Moreover, the Proteobacteria/Firmicutes ratio was overrepresented, and functional pathways related to the biosynthesis of LPS components were increased in the INSTI + MetS group. The gut microbiota of patients receiving INSTIs showed a more pronounced dysbiosis orchestrated by decreased bacterial richness and diversity, with an almost complete absence of SCFA-producing bacteria and alterations in gut microbiota functional pathways. These findings have not been previously observed.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis",Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
211,2023,Phenotypic and Molecular Characteristics of Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii Isolates from Bulgarian Intensive Care Unit Patients,"Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) is designated as an urgent public health threat, both due to its remarkable multidrug resistance and propensity for clonal spread. This study aimed to explore the phenotypic and molecular characteristics of antimicrobial resistance in CRAB isolates (n = 73) from intensive care unit (ICU) patients in two university hospitals in Bulgaria (2018–2019). The methodology included antimicrobial susceptibility testing, PCR, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and phylogenomic analysis. The resistance rates were as follows: imipenem, 100%; meropenem, 100%; amikacin, 98.6%; gentamicin, 89%; tobramycin, 86.3%; levofloxacin, 100%; trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, 75.3%; tigecycline, 86.3%; colistin, 0%; and ampicillin–sulbactam, 13.7%. All isolates harbored blaOXA-51-like genes. The frequencies of distribution of other antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) were: blaOXA-23-like, 98.6%; blaOXA-24/40-like, 2.7%; armA, 86.3%; and sul1, 75.3%. The WGS of selected extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii (XDR-AB) isolates (n = 3) revealed the presence of OXA-23 and OXA-66 carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D β-lactamases in all isolates, and OXA-72 carbapenemase in one of them. Various insertion sequencies, such as ISAba24, ISAba31, ISAba125, ISVsa3, IS17, and IS6100, were also detected, providing increased ability for horizontal transfer of ARGs. The isolates belonged to the widespread high-risk sequence types ST2 (n = 2) and ST636 (n = 1) (Pasteur scheme). Our results show the presence of XDR-AB isolates, carrying a variety of ARGs, in Bulgarian ICU settings, which highlights the crucial need for nationwide surveillance, especially in the conditions of extensive antibiotic usage during COVID-19.",,"Isolate, AMR",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease
212,2023,kb_DRAM: annotation and metabolic profiling of genomes with DRAM in KBase,"Abstract   Microbial genome annotation is the process of identifying structural and functional elements in DNA sequences and subsequently attaching biological information to those elements. DRAM is a tool developed to annotate bacterial, archaeal, and viral genomes derived from pure cultures or metagenomes. DRAM goes beyond traditional annotation tools by distilling multiple gene annotations to genome level summaries of functional potential. Despite these benefits, a downside of DRAM is the requirement of large computational resources, which limits its accessibility. Further, it did not integrate with downstream metabolic modeling tools that require genome annotation. To alleviate these constraints, DRAM and the viral counterpart, DRAM-v, are now available and integrated with the freely accessible KBase cyberinfrastructure. With kb_DRAM users can generate DRAM annotations and functional summaries from microbial or viral genomes in a point-and-click interface, as well as generate genome-scale metabolic models from DRAM annotations. Availability and implementation For kb_DRAM users, the kb_DRAM apps on KBase can be found in the catalog at https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/modules/kb_DRAM. For kb_DRAM users, a tutorial workflow with all documentation is available at https://narrative.kbase.us/narrative/129480.

213,2023,An efficient method for high molecular weight bacterial DNA extraction suitable for shotgun metagenomics from skin swabs,"The human skin microbiome represents a variety of complex microbial ecosystems that play a key role in host health. Molecular methods to study these communities have been developed but have been largely limited to low-throughput quantification and short amplicon sequencing, providing limited functional information about the communities present. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing has emerged as a preferred method for microbiome studies as it provides more comprehensive information about the species/strains present in a niche and the genes they encode. However, the relatively low bacterial biomass of skin, in comparison to other areas such as the gut microbiome, makes obtaining sufficient DNA for shotgun metagenomic sequencing challenging. Here we describe an optimised high-throughput method for extraction of high molecular weight DNA suitable for shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We validated the performance of the extraction method, and analysis pipeline on skin swabs collected from both adults and babies. The pipeline effectively characterised the bacterial skin microbiota with a cost and throughput suitable for larger longitudinal sets of samples. Application of this method will allow greater insights into community compositions and functional capabilities of the skin microbiome. Impact Statement Determining the functional capabilities of microbial communities within different human microbiomes is important to understand their impacts on health. Extraction of sufficient DNA is challenging, especially from low biomass samples, such as skin swabs suitable for shotgun metagenomics, which is needed for taxonomic resolution and functional information. Here we describe an optimised DNA extraction method that produces enough DNA from skin swabs, suitable for shotgun metagenomics, and demonstrate it can be used to effectively characterise the skin microbiota. This method will allow future studies to identify taxonomic and functional changes in the skin microbiota which is needed to develop interventions to improve and maintain skin health.

214,2023,Seasonal Shifts in Community Composition and Proteome Expression in a Sulfur-Cycling Cyanobacterial Mat,"Seasonal changes in light and physicochemical conditions have strong impacts on cyanobacteria, but how they affect community structure, metabolism, and biogeochemistry of cyanobacterial mats remains unclear. Light may be particularly influential for cyanobacterial mats exposed to sulfide by altering the balance of oxygenic photosynthesis and sulfide-driven anoxygenic photosynthesis. We studied temporal shifts in irradiance, water chemistry, and community structure and function of microbial mats in Middle Island Sinkhole (MIS), where anoxic and sulfate-rich groundwater provides habitat for cyanobacteria that conduct both oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis. Seasonal changes in light and groundwater chemistry were accompanied by shifts in bacterial community composition, with a succession of dominant cyanobacteria from Phormidium to Planktothrix, and an increase in diatoms, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, and sulfate-reducing bacteria from summer to autumn. Differential abundance of cyanobacterial light harvesting proteins likely reflects a physiological response of cyanobacteria to light level. Beggiatoa sulfur oxidation proteins were more abundant in autumn. Correlated abundances of taxa through time suggest interactions between sulfur oxidizers and sulfate reducers, sulfate reducers and heterotrophs, and cyanobacteria and heterotrophs. These results support the conclusion that seasonal change, including light availability, has a strong influence on community composition and biogeochemical cycling of sulfur and O2 in cyanobacterial mats. Originality-Significance Statement Cyanobacterial mats are found in terrestrial and aquatic environments on modern Earth and their fossil remains are present throughout the geologic record. They are biogeochemical oases that underpin diverse metabolic interactions, transform key nutrients and fix carbon, and can thrive in extreme environments. Mat-forming cyanobacteria can be metabolically versatile and conduct both oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis using sulfide (OP and AP), thereby participating in both oxygen and sulfur cycling. The effect of seasonality on ecological factors constraining photosynthetic production and geochemical cycling in extreme cyanobacterial mats is not well known. In this study, we surveyed the mat community composition via bacterial 16S rRNA genes, microbial activity via metaproteomics, and water physico- and geochemistry over multiple seasons and years of the cyanobacterial mat in Middle Island Sinkhole, an O2-poor benthic sinkhole in Lake Huron, Michigan. We found that higher availability of sulfate-rich groundwater, together with higher light intensity, coincided with dominance of the metabolically flexible cyanobacterium Phormidium during the summer. Diverse sulfur cycling bacteria were more successful in other seasons when the mat experienced lower light and sulfate availability. These results provide insights into how seasonal environmental dynamics can shape the community structure and metabolisms of microbial mats, ultimately controlling biogeochemical cycling in these ecological hotspots.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome","Metabarcoding, (Meta)proteomics, Metaproteomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
215,2023,Insufficient Evidence of a Breastmilk Microbiota at Six-Weeks Postpartum: A Pilot Study,"Breastmilk is thought to influence the infant gut by supplying prebiotics in the form of human milk oligosaccharides and potentially seeding the gut with breastmilk microbes. However, the presence of a breastmilk microbiota and origins of these microbes are still debated. As a pilot study, we assessed the microbes present in expressed breastmilk at six-weeks postpartum using shotgun metagenomic sequencing in a heterogenous cohort of women who delivered by vaginal (n = 8) and caesarean delivery (n = 8). In addition, we estimated the microbial load of breastmilk at six-weeks post-partum with quantitative PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene. Breastmilk at six-weeks postpartum had a low microbial mass, comparable with PCR no-template and extraction controls. Microbes identified through metagenomic sequencing were largely consistent with skin and oral microbes, with four samples returning no identifiable bacterial sequences. Our results do not provide convincing evidence for the existence of a breastmilk microbiota at six-weeks postpartum. It is more likely that microbes present in breastmilk are sourced by ejection from the infant’s mouth and from surrounding skin, as well as contamination during sampling and processing.","Bacteria, Microbiome",,"Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Health & Disease
216,2022,MetaAnalyst: a user-friendly tool for metagenomic biomarker detection and phenotype classification,"Background Many metagenomic studies have linked the imbalance in microbial abundance profiles to a wide range of diseases. These studies suggest utilizing the microbial abundance profiles as potential markers for metagenomic-associated conditions. Due to the inevitable importance of biomarkers in understanding the disease progression and the development of possible therapies, various computational tools have been proposed for metagenomic biomarker detection. However, most existing tools require prior scripting knowledge and lack user friendly interfaces, causing considerable time and effort to install, configure, and run these tools. Besides, there is no available all-in-one solution for running and comparing various metagenomic biomarker detection simultaneously. In addition, most of these tools just present the suggested biomarkers without any statistical evaluation for their quality. Results To overcome these limitations, this work presents MetaAnalyst, a software package with a simple graphical user interface (GUI) that (i) automates the installation and configuration of 28 state-of-the-art tools, (ii) supports flexible study design to enable studying the dataset under different scenarios smoothly, iii) runs and evaluates several algorithms simultaneously iv) supports different input formats and provides the user with several preprocessing capabilities, v) provides a variety of metrics to evaluate the quality of the suggested markers, and vi) presents the outcomes in the form of publication quality plots with various formatting capabilities as well as Excel sheets.

217,2022,A Deep Learning Approach to Predict Health Status Using Microbiome Profiling,"The human microbiome consists of the microbes that live in and on our body and it plays an important part in our life helping in digestion, developing immunity, etc. There are mounting evidence that shows the relationship between the composition of the gut microbiome and the occurence of various diseases such as type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer and liver cirrhosis. Machine learning approaches have been used to predict the likelihood of having such diseases using the microbial profile of an individual. In this paper, we explore a deep learning approach to predict health status of an individual utilizing their gut microbial profile. Health state prediction was performed using a dataset containing healthy and non-healthy raw shotgun stool metagenomics samples profiled at species and genera levels. The species level profiles outperformed the genera level profiles in terms of AUC giving a score of 0.957. The best performance for the deep learning approach recorded an AUC score of 0.98 for species level profiles when the sparseness in the datasets were removed.

Few studies have investigated the effects of FRG containing prebiotics on the gut microbiota. Here, 29 Korean women aged ≥ 50 years were administered FRG for three weeks to determine its effect on stool characteristics, biochemical parameters, and gut microbiome. Gut microbial DNA was subjected to 16S rRNA V3–V4 region sequencing to assess microbial distribution in different stages. Additionally, the stool consistency, frequency of bowel movements, and biochemical parameters of blood were evaluated. We found that FRG intake improved stool consistency and increased the frequency of bowel movements compared to before intake. Biochemical parameters such as glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase decreased and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased with FRG intake. Gut microbiome analysis revealed 20 specific bacteria after three weeks of FRG intake. Additionally, 16 pathways correlated with the 20 specific bacteria were enhanced after red ginseng intake. In conclusion, FRG promoted health in elderly women by lowering blood glucose levels and improving bowel movement frequency. The increase in bacteria observed with FRG ingestion supports these findings.","Bacteria, Microbiome",,Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
219,2022,Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 bacteriophage potential in human gut microbiota,"Background In previous studies we have shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replicates in vitro in bacterial growth medium, that the viral replication follows bacterial growth, and it is influenced by the administration of specific antibiotics. These observations are compatible with a ‘bacteriophage-like’ behaviour of SARS-CoV-2. Methods We have further elaborated on these unusual findings and here we present the results of three different supplementary experiments: (1) an electron-microscope analysis of samples of bacteria obtained from a faecal sample of a subject positive to SARS-CoV-2; (2) mass spectrometric analysis of these cultures to assess the eventual de novo synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein; (3) sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 collected from plaques obtained from two different gut microbial bacteria inoculated with supernatant from faecal microbiota of an individual positive to SARS-CoV-2. Results Immuno-labelling with Anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein antibody confirmed presence of SARS-CoV-2 both outside and inside bacteria. De novo synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was observed, as evidence that SARS-CoV-2 RNA is translated in the bacterial cultures. In addition, phage-like plaques were spotted on faecal bacteria cultures after inoculation with supernatant from faecal microbiota of an individual positive to SARS-CoV-2. Bioinformatic analyses on the reads obtained by sequencing RNA extracted from the plaques revealed nucleic acid polymorphisms, suggesting different replication environment in the two bacterial cultures. Conclusions Based on these results we conclude that, in addition to its well-documented interactions with eukaryotic cells, SARS-CoV-2 may act as a bacteriophage when interacting with at least two bacterial species known to be present in the human microbiota. If the hypothesis proposed, i.e., that under certain conditions SARS-CoV-2 may multiply at the expense of human gut bacteria, is further substantiated, it would drastically change the model of acting and infecting of SARS-CoV-2, and most likely that of other human pathogenic viruses.","Bacteria, Virus, Eukaryote, Microbiome, Pathogen",Interactome,,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
220,2022,The transcription factor HLH-26 controls probiotic-mediated protection against intestinal infection through up-regulation of the Wnt/BAR-1 pathway,"Probiotics play a critical role in the control of host intestinal microbial balance, protecting the host from gastrointestinal pathogens, modulating the host immune response, and decreasing host susceptibility to infection. To understand the mechanism underlying the protective effect of probiotics against infections through immune regulation, we examined protection against Salmonella enterica infection following exposure to nonpathogenic Enterococcus faecium in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that the transcription factor HLH-26, a REF-1 family member of basic helix–loop–helix transcription factors, was required in the intestine for E. faecium–mediated protection of C. elegans against a lethal S. enterica infection. In addition, we uncovered that defense response genes controlled by the canonical Wnt/BAR-1 pathway were activated upon exposure to E. faecium in an HLH-26–dependent manner. Our findings highlight a role for REF-1/HLH-26 in the control of the Wnt/BAR-1 pathway in probiotic-mediated protection against gut infection.",Pathogen,,,Health & Disease
221,2021,The treasure inside barley seeds: microbial diversity and plant beneficial bacteria,"Bacteria associated with plants can enhance the plants’ growth and resistance against phytopathogens. Today, growers aim to reduce the use of mineral fertilizers and pesticides. Since phytopathogens cause severe yield losses in crop production systems, biological alternatives gain more attention. Plant and also seed endophytes have the potential to influence the plant, especially seed-borne bacteria may express their beneficiary impact at initial plant developmental stages. In the current study, we assessed the endophytic seed microbiome of seven genetically diverse barley accessions by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and verified the in vitro plant beneficial potential of isolated seed endophytes. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of the barley genotype and its seed microbiome on the rhizosphere microbiome at an early growth stage by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The plant genotype displayed a significant impact on the microbiota in both barley seed and rhizosphere. Consequently, the microbial alpha- and beta-diversity of the endophytic seed microbiome was highly influenced by the genotype. Interestingly, no correlation was observed between the endophytic seed microbiome and the single nucleotide polymorphisms of the seven genotypes. Unclassified members of Enterobacteriaceae were by far most dominant. Other abundant genera in the seed microbiome belonged to Curtobacterium, Paenibacillus, Pantoea, Sanguibacter and Saccharibacillus. Endophytes isolated from barley seeds were affiliated to dominant genera of the core seed microbiome, based on their 16S rRNA gene sequence. Most of these endophytic isolates produced in vitro plant beneficial secondary metabolites known to induce plant resistance. Although barley accessions representing high genetic diversity displayed a genotype-dependent endophytic seed microbiome, a core seed microbiome with high relative abundances was identified. Endophytic isolates were affiliated to members of the core seed microbiome and many of them showed plant beneficial properties. We propose therefore that new breeding strategies should consider genotypes with high abundance of beneficial microbes.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR","Metabarcoding, Metabolomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

ABSTRACT Biotechnology has experienced innovations in analytics and data processing. As the volume of data and its complexity grow, new computational procedures for extracting information are being developed. However, the rate of change outpaces the adaptation of biotechnology curricula, necessitating new teaching methodologies to equip biotechnologists with data analysis abilities. To simulate experimental data, we created a virtual organism simulator (silvio) by combining diverse cellular and subcellular microbial models. With the silvio Python package, we constructed a computer-based instructional workflow to teach growth curve data analysis, promoter sequence design, and expression rate measurement. The instructional workflow is a Jupyter Notebook with background explanations and Python-based experiment simulations combined. The data analysis is conducted either within the Notebook in Python or externally with Excel. This instructional workflow was separately implemented in two distance courses for Master's students in biology and biotechnology with assessment of the pedagogic efficiency. The concept of using virtual organism simulations that generate coherent results across different experiments can be used to construct consistent and motivating case studies for biotechnological data literacy.",,,,

224,2021,Staphylococcus epidermidis Phages Transduce Antimicrobial Resistance Plasmids and Mobilize Chromosomal Islands,"Multidrug-resistant strains of S. epidermidis emerge in both nosocomial and livestock environments as the most important pathogens among coagulase-negative staphylococcal species. The study of transduction by phages is essential to understanding how virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes spread in originally commensal bacterial populations. ABSTRACT Staphylococcus epidermidis is a leading opportunistic pathogen causing nosocomial infections that is notable for its ability to form a biofilm and for its high rates of antibiotic resistance. It serves as a reservoir of multiple antimicrobial resistance genes that spread among the staphylococcal population by horizontal gene transfer such as transduction. While phage-mediated transduction is well studied in Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis transducing phages have not been described in detail yet. Here, we report the characteristics of four phages, 27, 48, 456, and 459, previously used for S. epidermidis phage typing, and the newly isolated phage E72, from a clinical S. epidermidis strain. The phages, classified in the family Siphoviridae and genus Phietavirus, exhibited an S. epidermidis-specific host range, and together they infected 49% of the 35 strains tested. A whole-genome comparison revealed evolutionary relatedness to transducing S. aureus phietaviruses. In accordance with this, all the tested phages were capable of transduction with high frequencies up to 10−4 among S. epidermidis strains from different clonal complexes. Plasmids with sizes from 4 to 19 kb encoding resistance to streptomycin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol were transferred. We provide here the first evidence of a phage-inducible chromosomal island transfer in S. epidermidis. Similarly to S. aureus pathogenicity islands, the transfer was accompanied by phage capsid remodeling; however, the interfering protein encoded by the island was distinct. Our findings underline the role of S. epidermidis temperate phages in the evolution of S. epidermidis strains by horizontal gene transfer, which can also be utilized for S. epidermidis genetic studies. IMPORTANCE Multidrug-resistant strains of S. epidermidis emerge in both nosocomial and livestock environments as the most important pathogens among coagulase-negative staphylococcal species. The study of transduction by phages is essential to understanding how virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes spread in originally commensal bacterial populations. In this work, we provide a detailed description of transducing S. epidermidis phages. The high transduction frequencies of antimicrobial resistance plasmids and the first evidence of chromosomal island transfer emphasize the decisive role of S. epidermidis phages in attaining a higher pathogenic potential of host strains. To date, such importance has been attributed only to S. aureus phages, not to those of coagulase-negative staphylococci. This study also proved that the described transducing bacteriophages represent valuable genetic modification tools in S. epidermidis strains where other methods for gene transfer fail.","Bacteria, Virus, Pathogen","Isolate, AMR",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
225,2021,Dynamic Changes in Fecal Microbial Communities of Neonatal Dairy Calves by Aging and Diarrhea,"Simple Summary The microbiota plays a pivotal role in the metabolism and health of animals. The gut microbiome is dynamically changed by various factors including age, diseases and diet. Before rumen development, most of the gut microbes are found in the colon. However, the diversification and functional changes in gut microbes of neonatal calves are not fully understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to understand the dynamic changes in the fecal microbiome of pre-weaned calves using metagenomic analysis. We observed dynamic changes in the microbial composition during the pre-weaning period of neonatal dairy calves. In addition, we observed a drastic shift in the gut microbiome during diarrheal disease. Thus, the functions and composition of the fecal microbiome were significantly different between diarrheal cows and healthy cows at the same age. Overall, the study findings provide a strong insight into how aging and diarrhea affect the microbial communities of neonatal dairy calves. The results of study help develop strategies to improve early life gut microbiota being significantly relevant to the health status of dairy cows. Abstract Microbiota plays a critical role in the overall growth performance and health status of dairy cows, especially during their early life. Several studies have reported that fecal microbiome of neonatal calves is shifted by various factors such as diarrhea, antibiotic treatment, or environmental changes. Despite the importance of gut microbiome, a lack of knowledge regarding the composition and functions of microbiota impedes the development of new strategies for improving growth performance and disease resistance during the neonatal calf period. In this study, we utilized next-generation sequencing to monitor the time-dependent dynamics of the gut microbiota of dairy calves before weaning (1–8 weeks of age) and further investigated the microbiome changes caused by diarrhea. Metagenomic analysis revealed that continuous changes, including increasing gut microbiome diversity, occurred from 1 to 5 weeks of age. However, the composition and diversity of the fecal microbiome did not change after 6 weeks of age. The most prominent changes in the fecal microbiome composition caused by aging at family level were a decreased abundance of Bacteroidaceae and Enterobacteriaceae and an increased abundance of Prevotellaceae. Phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) analysis indicated that the abundance of microbial genes associated with various metabolic pathways changed with aging. All calves with diarrhea symptoms showed drastic microbiome changes and about a week later returned to the microbiome of pre-diarrheal stage regardless of age. At phylum level, abundance of Bacteroidetes was decreased (p = 0.09) and that of Proteobacteria increased (p = 0.07) during diarrhea. PICRUSt analysis indicated that microbial metabolism-related genes, such as starch and sucrose metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, alanine aspartate, and glutamate metabolism were significantly altered in diarrheal calves. Together, these results highlight the important implications of gut microbiota in gut metabolism and health status of neonatal dairy calves.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, AMR","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
226,2021,"A Bioinformatics Whole-Genome Sequencing Workflow for Clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex Isolate Analysis, Validated Using a Reference Collection Extensively Characterized with Conventional Methods and In Silico Approaches","The use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for routine typing of bacterial isolates has increased substantially in recent years. For Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), in particular, WGS has the benefit of drastically reducing the time required to generate results compared to most conventional phenotypic methods. ABSTRACT The use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for routine typing of bacterial isolates has increased substantially in recent years. For Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), in particular, WGS has the benefit of drastically reducing the time required to generate results compared to most conventional phenotypic methods. Consequently, a multitude of solutions for analyzing WGS MTB data have been developed, but their successful integration in clinical and national reference laboratories is hindered by the requirement for their validation, for which a consensus framework is still largely absent. We developed a bioinformatics workflow for (Illumina) WGS-based routine typing of MTB complex (MTBC) member isolates allowing complete characterization, including (sub)species confirmation and identification (16S, csb/RD, hsp65), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based antimicrobial resistance (AMR) prediction, and pathogen typing (spoligotyping, SNP barcoding, and core genome multilocus sequence typing). Workflow performance was validated on a per-assay basis using a collection of 238 in-house-sequenced MTBC isolates, extensively characterized with conventional molecular biology-based approaches supplemented with public data. For SNP-based AMR prediction, results from molecular genotyping methods were supplemented with in silico modified data sets, allowing us to greatly increase the set of evaluated mutations. The workflow demonstrated very high performance with performance metrics of >99% for all assays, except for spoligotyping, where sensitivity dropped to ∼90%. The validation framework for our WGS-based bioinformatics workflow can aid in the standardization of bioinformatics tools by the MTB community and other SNP-based applications regardless of the targeted pathogen(s). The bioinformatics workflow is available for academic and nonprofit use through the Galaxy instance of our institute at https://galaxy.sciensano.be.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR, SNP, (M)LST","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics",Health & Disease
227,2021,"Long-Term Exposure to Octenidine in a Simulated Sink Trap Environment Results in Selection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter, and Enterobacter Isolates with Mutations in Efflux Pump Regulators","Multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of bacteria are a major clinical problem, and several reports have linked outbreaks of MDR bacteria with bacterial populations in hospital sinks. Biocides such as octenidine are used clinically in body washes and other products, such as wound dressings for infection control. ABSTRACT Octenidine-based disinfection products are becoming increasingly popular for infection control of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative isolates. When a waste trap was removed from a hospital and allowed to acclimatize in a standard tap rig in our laboratory, it was shown that Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Citrobacter and Enterobacter spp. were readily isolated. This study aimed to understand the potential impact of prolonged exposure to low doses of a commercial product containing octenidine on these bacteria. Phenotypic and genotypic analyses showed that P. aeruginosa strains had increased tolerance to octenidine, which was characterized by mutations in the Tet repressor SmvR. Enterobacter species demonstrated increased tolerance to many other cationic biocides, although not octenidine, as well as the antibiotics ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, and ceftazidime, through mutations in another Tet repressor, RamR. Citrobacter species with mutations in RamR and MarR were identified following octenidine exposure, and this is linked to development of resistance to ampicillin, piperacillin, and chloramphenicol, as well as an increased MIC for ciprofloxacin. Isolates were able to retain fitness, as characterized by growth, biofilm formation, and virulence in Galleria mellonella, after prolonged contact with octenidine, although there were strain-to-strain differences. These results demonstrate that continued low-level octenidine exposure in a simulated sink trap environment selects for mutations that affect smvR. It may also promote microbial adaptation to other cationic biocides and cross-resistance to antibiotics, while not incurring a fitness cost. This suggests that hospital sink traps may act as a reservoir for more biocide-tolerant organisms. IMPORTANCE Multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of bacteria are a major clinical problem, and several reports have linked outbreaks of MDR bacteria with bacterial populations in hospital sinks. Biocides such as octenidine are used clinically in body washes and other products, such as wound dressings for infection control. Therefore, increased tolerance to these biocides would be detrimental to infection control processes. Here, we exposed bacterial populations originally from hospital sink traps to repeated dosing with an octenidine-containing product over several weeks and observed how particular species adapted. We found mutations in genes related to biocide and antibiotic susceptibility, which resulted in increased tolerance, although this was species dependent. Bacteria that became more tolerant to octenidine also showed no loss of fitness. This shows that prolonged octenidine exposure has the potential to promote microbial adaptation in the environment and that hospital sink traps may act as a reservoir for increased biocide- and antibiotic-tolerant organisms.",Bacteria,"Isolate, AMR",,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
228,2021,Soil microbial communities influencing organic phosphorus mineralization in a coastal dune chronosequence in New Zealand.,"The Haast chronosequence in New Zealand is a ∼6500-year dune formation series, characterized by rapid podzol development, phosphorus (P) depletion, and a decline in aboveground biomass. We examined bacterial and fungal community composition within mineral soil fractions using amplicon-based high-throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq). We targeted bacterial non-specific acid (class A, phoN/phoC) and alkaline (phoD) phosphomonoesterase genes and quantified specific genes and transcripts using real-time PCR. Soil bacterial diversity was greatest after 4000 years of ecosystem development and associated with an increased richness of phylotypes and a significant decline in previously dominant taxa (Firmicutes and Proteobacteria). Soil fungal communities transitioned from predominantly Basidiomycota to Ascomycota along the chronosequence and were most diverse in 290 to 392-year-old soils, coinciding with maximum tree basal area and organic P accumulation. The Bacteria: Fungi ratio decreased amid a competitive and interconnected soil community as determined by network analysis. Overall, soil microbial communities were associated with soil changes and declining P throughout pedogenesis and ecosystem succession. We identified an increased dependence on organic P mineralization, as found by the profiled acid phosphatase genes, soil acid phosphatase activity, and function inference from predicted metagenomes (PICRUSt2).","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
229,2021,Functional plasticity in oyster gut microbiomes along a eutrophication gradient in an urbanized estuary,"Oysters in coastal environments are subject to fluctuating environmental conditions that may impact the ecosystem services they provide. Oyster-associated microbiomes are responsible for some of these services, particularly nutrient cycling in benthic habitats. The effects of climate change on host-associated microbiome composition are well-known, but functional changes and how they may impact host physiology and ecosystem functioning are poorly characterized. We investigated how environmental parameters affect oyster-associated microbial community structure and function along a trophic gradient in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA. Adult eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, gut and seawater samples were collected at 5 sites along this estuarine nutrient gradient in August 2017. Samples were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize bacterial community structures and metatranscriptomes were sequenced to determine oyster gut microbiome responses to local environments. There were significant differences in bacterial community structure between the eastern oyster gut and water samples, suggesting selection of certain taxa by the oyster host. Increasing salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen, and decreasing nitrate, nitrite and phosphate concentrations were observed along the North to South gradient. Transcriptionally active bacterial taxa were similar for the different sites, but expression of oyster-associated microbial genes involved in nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) cycling varied throughout the Bay, reflecting the local nutrient regimes and prevailing environmental conditions. The observed shifts in microbial community composition and function inform how estuarine conditions affect host-associated microbiomes and their ecosystem services. As the effects of estuarine acidification are expected to increase due to the combined effects of eutrophication, coastal pollution, and climate change, it is important to determine relationships between host health, microbial community structure, and environmental conditions in benthic communities.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis","Metabarcoding, (Meta)transcriptomics, Metatranscriptomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
230,2020,Cascabel: A Scalable and Versatile Amplicon Sequence Data Analysis Pipeline Delivering Reproducible and Documented Results,"Marker gene sequencing of the rRNA operon (16S, 18S, ITS) or cytochrome c oxidase I (CO1) is a popular means to assess microbial communities of the environment, microbiomes associated with plants and animals, as well as communities of multicellular organisms via environmental DNA sequencing. Since this technique is based on sequencing a single gene, or even only parts of a single gene rather than the entire genome, the number of reads needed per sample to assess the microbial community structure is lower than that required for metagenome sequencing. This makes marker gene sequencing affordable to nearly any laboratory. Despite the relative ease and cost-efficiency of data generation, analyzing the resulting sequence data requires computational skills that may go beyond the standard repertoire of a current molecular biologist/ecologist. We have developed Cascabel, a scalable, flexible, and easy-to-use amplicon sequence data analysis pipeline, which uses Snakemake and a combination of existing and newly developed solutions for its computational steps. Cascabel takes the raw data as input and delivers a table of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) or Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) in BIOM and text format and representative sequences. Cascabel is a highly versatile software that allows users to customize several steps of the pipeline, such as selecting from a set of OTU clustering methods or performing ASV analysis. In addition, we designed Cascabel to run in any linux/unix computing environment from desktop computers to computing servers making use of parallel processing if possible.

Primycin is a large 36-membered non-polyene macrolide lactone exclusively produced by Saccharomonospora azurea. This study provides information about strain dependent primycin production ability in conjunction with the structural, functional and comparative genomic examinations. Comparison of high- and low-primycin producer strains, transcriptomic analysis identified a total of 686 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), classified into diverse Cluster of Orthologous Groups. Among them, genes related to fatty acid synthesis, self-resistance, regulation of secondary metabolism and agmatinase encoding gene responsible for catalyze conversion between guanidino/amino forms of primycin were discussed. Based on in silico data mining methods, we were able to identify DEGs whose altered expression provide a good starting point for the optimization of fermentation processes, in order to perform targeted strain improvement and rational drug design.",Pathogen,"Functional analysis, AMR, Comparative analysis","(Meta)genomics, (Meta)transcriptomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
232,2020,Expanded Phylogenetic Diversity and Metabolic Flexibility of Mercury-Methylating Microorganisms,"Accurately assessing the production of bioaccumulative neurotoxic methylmercury by characterizing the phylogenetic diversity, metabolic functions, and activity of methylators in the environment is crucial for understanding constraints on the mercury cycle. Much of our understanding of methylmercury production is based on cultured anaerobic microorganisms within the Deltaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Euryarchaeota. Advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have enabled large-scale cultivation-independent surveys of diverse and poorly characterized microorganisms from numerous ecosystems. We used genome-resolved metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to highlight the vast phylogenetic and metabolic diversity of putative mercury methylators and their depth-discrete activities in thawing permafrost. This work underscores the importance of using genome-resolved metagenomics to survey specific putative methylating populations of a given mercury-impacted ecosystem. ABSTRACT Methylmercury is a potent bioaccumulating neurotoxin that is produced by specific microorganisms that methylate inorganic mercury. Methylmercury production in diverse anaerobic bacteria and archaea was recently linked to the hgcAB genes. However, the full phylogenetic and metabolic diversity of mercury-methylating microorganisms has not been fully unraveled due to the limited number of cultured experimentally verified methylators and the limitations of primer-based molecular methods. Here, we describe the phylogenetic diversity and metabolic flexibility of putative mercury-methylating microorganisms by hgcAB identification in publicly available isolate genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) as well as novel freshwater MAGs. We demonstrate that putative mercury methylators are much more phylogenetically diverse than previously known and that hgcAB distribution among genomes is most likely due to several independent horizontal gene transfer events. The microorganisms we identified possess diverse metabolic capabilities spanning carbon fixation, sulfate reduction, nitrogen fixation, and metal resistance pathways. We identified 111 putative mercury methylators in a set of previously published permafrost metatranscriptomes and demonstrated that different methylating taxa may contribute to hgcA expression at different depths. Overall, we provide a framework for illuminating the microbial basis of mercury methylation using genome-resolved metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to identify putative methylators based upon hgcAB presence and describe their putative functions in the environment.

236,2020,Survey of metaproteomics software tools for functional microbiome analysis,"To gain a thorough appreciation of microbiome dynamics, researchers characterize the functional role of expressed microbial genes/proteins. This can be accomplished through metaproteomics, which characterizes the protein complement of the microbiome. Several software tools exist for analyzing microbiomes at the functional level by measuring their combined proteome-level response to environmental perturbations. In this survey, we explore the performance of six available tools, so that researchers can make informed decisions regarding software choice based on their research goals. Tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic data obtained from dental carie plaque samples grown with and without sucrose in paired biofilm reactors were used as representative data for this evaluation. Microbial peptides from one sample pair were identified by the X! Tandem search algorithm via SearchGUI and subjected to functional analysis using software tools including eggNOG-mapper, MEGAN6, MetaGOmics, MetaProteomeAnalyzer (MPA), ProPHAnE, and Unipept to generate functional annotation through Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Among these software tools, notable differences in functional annotation were detected after comparing differentially expressed protein functional groups. Based on the generated GO terms of these tools we performed a peptide-level comparison to evaluate the quality of their functional annotations. A BLAST analysis against the Universal Protein Knowledgebase revealed that the sensitivity and specificity of functional annotation differed between tools. For example, eggNOG-mapper mapped to the most number of GO terms, while Unipept generated the most precise GO terms. Based on our evaluation, metaproteomics researchers can choose the software according to their analytical needs and developers can use the resulting feedback to further optimize their algorithms.

239,2019,Of Microbes and Mange: Consistent changes in the skin microbiome of three canid species infected with sarcoptic mange,"Sarcoptic mange is a highly contagious skin disease caused by the ectoparasitic mite, Sarcoptes scabiei. Although it afflicts over 100 mammal species worldwide, sarcoptic mange remains a disease obscured by variability at the individual, population, and species levels. Amid this variability, it is critical to identify consistent drivers of morbidity, particularly at the skin barrier. We characterized the skin microbiome of three species of North American canids: coyotes (Canis latrans), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), and gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus). Comparing mange-infected and uninfected individuals, we found remarkably consistent signatures of microbial dysbiosis associated with mange infection. Across genera, mange-infected canids exhibited reduced microbial diversity, altered community composition, and increased abundance of opportunistic pathogens. The primary bacteria comprising these secondary infections were Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, previously associated with canid ear and skin infections, and Corynebacterium spp, previously found among the gut flora of S. scabiei mites and hematophagous arthropods. Considered together, this evidence suggests that mange infection consistently alters the canid skin microbiome and facilitates secondary bacterial infection. These results provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of mange at the skin barrier of North American canids and can inspire novel treatment strategies. By further adopting a “One Health” framework that considers mites, microbes, and the potential for interspecies transmission, we can better elucidate the patterns and processes underlying this ubiquitous and enigmatic disease.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen",Community (taxonomy) profiling,,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

Using a case study, we showcase metaQuantome's publication-ready visualizations. metaQuantome will enable advanced multi-omic microbiome analysis. Microbiome research offers promising insights into the impact of microorganisms on biological systems. Metaproteomics, the study of microbial proteins at the community level, integrates genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data to determine the taxonomic and functional state of a microbiome. However, standard metaproteomics software is subject to several limitations, commonly supporting only spectral counts, emphasizing exploratory analysis rather than hypothesis testing and rarely offering the ability to analyze the interaction of function and taxonomy - that is, which taxa are responsible for different processes. Here we present metaQuantome, a novel, multifaceted software suite that analyzes the state of a microbiome by leveraging complex taxonomic and functional hierarchies to summarize peptide-level quantitative information, emphasizing label-free intensity-based methods. For experiments with multiple experimental conditions, metaQuantome offers differential abundance analysis, principal components analysis, and clustered heat map visualizations, as well as exploratory analysis for a single sample or experimental condition. We benchmark metaQuantome analysis against standard methods, using two previously published datasets: (1) an artificially assembled microbial community dataset (taxonomy benchmarking) and (2) a dataset with a range of recombinant human proteins spiked into an Escherichia coli background (functional benchmarking). Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of metaQuantome on a previously published human oral microbiome dataset. In both the taxonomic and functional benchmarking analyses, metaQuantome quantified taxonomic and functional terms more accurately than standard summarization-based methods. We use the oral microbiome dataset to demonstrate metaQuantome's ability to produce publication-quality figures and elucidate biological processes of the oral microbiome. metaQuantome enables advanced investigation of metaproteomic datasets, which should be broadly applicable to microbiome-related research.

241,2019,Microbial dysbiosis and its implications for disease in a genetically depauperate species,"THE host-associated microbiome is increasingly recognized as a critical player in health and immunity. When commensal microbial communities are disrupted, dysbiosis can contribute to disease pathogenesis and severity. Santa Catalina Island foxes (Urocyon littoralis catalinae) present an ideal case study for examining dysbiosis in wildlife due to their depauperate genomic structure and extremely high prevalence of ear canal tumors. Although the precise cause is yet unknown, infection with ear mites (Otodectes cynotis) has been linked to chronic inflammation, which is associated with abnormal cell growth and tumor development. Given the paucity of genomic variation in these foxes, other dimensions of molecular diversity, such as commensal microbes, may be critical to host response and adaptation. We therefore characterized the host-associated microbiome across six body sites of Santa Catalina Island foxes, and performed differential abundance testing between healthy and mite-infected ear canals. We found that mite infection was significantly associated with reduced microbial diversity and evenness, with the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus pseudintermedius dominating the ear canal community. These results suggest that secondary bacterial infection may contribute to the sustained inflammation associated with tumor development. Uncovering high abundance of S. pseudintermedius provides critical insight into the pathogenesis of this complex system, as the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains remains a concern of the medical, veterinary, and conservation communities. Through use of culture-independent sequencing techniques, this study contributes to the broader effort of applying a more inclusive understanding of molecular diversity to questions within wildlife disease ecology.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
242,2019,Studying the microbiota of bats: Accuracy of direct and indirect samplings,"Abstract Given the recurrent bat‐associated disease outbreaks in humans and recent advances in metagenomics sequencing, the microbiota of bats is increasingly being studied. However, obtaining biological samples directly from wild individuals may represent a challenge, and thus, indirect passive sampling (without capturing bats) is sometimes used as an alternative. Currently, it is not known whether the bacterial community assessed using this approach provides an accurate representation of the bat microbiota. This study was designed to compare the use of direct sampling (based on bat capture and handling) and indirect sampling (collection of bat's excretions under bat colonies) in assessing bacterial communities in bats. Using high‐throughput 16S rRNA sequencing of urine and feces samples from Rousettus aegyptiacus, a cave‐dwelling fruit bat species, we found evidence of niche specialization among different excreta samples, independent of the sampling approach. However, sampling approach influenced both the alpha‐ and beta‐diversity of urinary and fecal microbiotas. In particular, increased alpha‐diversity and more overlapping composition between urine and feces samples was seen when direct sampling was used, suggesting that cross‐contamination may occur when collecting samples directly from bats in hand. In contrast, results from indirect sampling in the cave may be biased by environmental contamination. Our methodological comparison suggested some influence of the sampling approach on the bat‐associated microbiota, but both approaches were able to capture differences among excreta samples. Assessment of these techniques opens an avenue to use more indirect sampling, in order to explore microbial community dynamics in bats.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,"Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
243,2016,SNVPhyl: a single nucleotide variant phylogenomics pipeline for microbial genomic epidemiology,"Motivation The recent widespread application of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for microbial disease investigations has spurred the development of new bioinformatics tools, including a notable proliferation of phylogenomics pipelines designed for infectious disease surveillance and outbreak investigation. Transitioning the use of WGS data out of the research lab and into the front lines of surveillance and outbreak response requires user-friendly, reproducible, and scalable pipelines that have been well validated. Results SNVPhyl (Single Nucleotide Variant Phylogenomics) is a bioinformatics pipeline for identifying high-quality SNVs and constructing a whole genome phylogeny from a collection of WGS reads and a reference genome. Individual pipeline components are integrated into the Galaxy bioinformatics framework, enabling data analysis in a user-friendly, reproducible, and scalable environment. We show that SNVPhyl can detect SNVs with high sensitivity and specificity and identify and remove regions of high SNV density (indicative of recombination). SNVPhyl is able to correctly distinguish outbreak from non-outbreak isolates across a range of variant-calling settings, sequencing-coverage thresholds, or in the presence of contamination. Availability SNVPhyl is available as a Galaxy workflow, Docker and virtual machine images, and a Unix-based command-line application. SNVPhyl is released under the Apache 2.0 license and available at http://snvphyl.readthedocs.io/ or at https://github.com/phac-nml/snvphyl-galaxy.",,"Isolate, Variant",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
244,2023,[Microbiome of therapeutic muds used in Tatarstan].,"Therapeutic muds (peloids), which are widely used for body healing, improve metabolism and have antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects due to enrichment with necessary microelements and biological active substances. However, the microbiological component of these effects is not well studied.


OBJECTIVE
To characterize the microbiome of therapeutic muds, used in the Tatarstan Republic, by identifying spectrum of cultivated microorganisms, using molecular analysis of bacterial communities, and by determining their biodiversity and functional potential based on revealed genetic determinants.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study design of 5 peloids samples (local sapropels and peat deposits of swamp; 3 samples of Crimean sulfide muds) included three main techniques: isolation and taxonomic determination of cultivated microorganisms by time-of-flight mass-spectrometry; molecular analysis of peloids bacterial communities by 16S RNA high-throughput sequencing; identification of functional profiles of communities by their genetic determinant using Global Mapper tool on iVikodak platform.


RESULTS
Experimental studies have confirmed the safety of examined peloids, where non-pathogenic cultivated bacteria belonging mainly to Bacillus and Rhodococcus genera were dominant. Metagenomic analysis showed that Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were predominant in all samples in different ratios. It has been established, that there is both the internal biodiversity of each sample and difference between them. The functional profile of microbial communities was determined based on the identification of bacterial genes. It has been revealed that all communities have an ability to synthesize antibiotics, as well as to decompose dangerous xenobiotics - polyaromatic hydrocarbons, cyclic compounds, and dioxins.


CONCLUSION
Various microbial communities, which were identified in the therapeutic muds, contribute both to the clearance of toxicants in the peloids and to the antibacterial properties of the latter. The obtained priority results create a fundamental basis for the subsequent study of the role of peloids' microbiome of different origin in their healing action.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
245,2025,Feature selection with vector-symbolic architectures: a case study on microbial profiles of shotgun metagenomic samples of colorectal cancer,"Abstract   The continuously decreasing cost of next-generation sequencing has recently led to a significant increase in the number of microbiome-related studies, providing invaluable information for understanding host–microbiome interactions and their relation to diseases. A common approach in metagenomics consists of determining the composition of samples in terms of the amount and types of microbial species that populate them, with the goal of identifying microbes whose profiles are able to differentiate samples under different conditions with advanced feature selection techniques. Here, we propose a novel backward variable selection method based on the hyperdimensional computing (HDC) paradigm, which takes inspiration from how the human brain works in the classification of concepts by encoding features into vectors in a high-dimensional space. We validated our method on public metagenomic samples collected from patients affected by colorectal cancer in a case/control scenario, by performing a comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art feature selection methods, obtaining promising results. Author summary Characterizing the microbial composition of metagenomic samples is crucial for identifying potential biomarkers that can distinguish between healthy and diseased states. However, the high dimensionality and complexity of metagenomic data present significant challenges in the context of accurately selecting features. Our backward variable selection method, based on the HDC paradigm, offers a promising approach to overcoming these challenges. By effectively reducing the feature space while preserving essential information, this method enhances the ability to detect critical microbial signatures associated with diseases like colorectal cancer, leading to more precise diagnostic tools.",Microbiome,"Interactome, Gene identification / Biomarker, Comparative analysis","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Health & Disease

247,2023,Genomic Characterization of Salmonella Isangi: A Global Perspective of a Rare Serovar,"Salmonella Isangi is an infrequent serovar that has recently been reported in several countries due to nosocomial infections. A considerable number of reports indicate Salmonella Isangi multidrug resistance, especially to cephalosporins, which could potentially pose a risk to public health worldwide. Genomic analysis is an excellent tool for monitoring the emergence of microorganisms and related factors. In this context, the aim of this study was to carry out a genomic analysis of Salmonella Isangi isolated from poultry in Brazil, and to compare it with the available genomes from the Pathogen Detection database and Sequence Read Archive. A total of 142 genomes isolated from 11 different countries were investigated. A broad distribution of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes was identified in the Salmonella Isangi genomes examined (blaCTX-M-15, blaCTX-M-2, blaDHA-1, blaNDM-1, blaOXA-10, blaOXA-1, blaOXA-48, blaSCO-1, blaSHV-5, blaTEM-131, blaTEM-1B), primarily in South Africa. Resistome analysis revealed predicted resistance to aminoglycoside, sulfonamide, macrolide, tetracycline, trimethoprim, phenicol, chloramphenicol, and quaternary ammonium. Additionally, PMQR (plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance) genes qnr19, qnrB1, and qnrS1 were identified, along with point mutations in the genes gyrAD87N, gyrAS83F, and gyrBS464F, which confer resistance to ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid. With regard to plasmids, we identified 17 different incompatibility groups, including IncC, Col(pHAD28), IncHI2, IncHI2A, IncM2, ColpVC, Col(Ye4449), Col156, IncR, IncI1(Alpha), IncFIB (pTU3), Col(B5512), IncQ1, IncL, IncN, IncFIB(pHCM2), and IncFIB (pN55391). Phylogenetic analysis revealed five clusters grouped by sequence type and antimicrobial gene distribution.

248,2023,Integrative meta-omics in Galaxy and beyond,"Background ‘Omics methods have empowered scientists to tackle the complexity of microbial communities on a scale not attainable before. Individually, omics analyses can provide great insight; while combined as “meta-omics”, they enhance the understanding of which organisms occupy specific metabolic niches, how they interact, and how they utilize environmental nutrients. Here we present three integrative meta-omics workflows, developed in Galaxy, for enhanced analysis and integration of metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metaproteomics, combined with our newly developed web-application, ViMO (Visualizer for Meta-Omics) to analyse metabolisms in complex microbial communities. Results In this study, we applied the workflows on a highly efficient cellulose-degrading minimal consortium enriched from a biogas reactor to analyse the key roles of uncultured microorganisms in complex biomass degradation processes. Metagenomic analysis recovered metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) for several constituent populations including  Hungateiclostridium thermocellum , Thermoclostridium stercorarium and multiple heterogenic strains affiliated to  Coprothermobacter proteolyticus . The metagenomics workflow was developed as two modules, one standard, and one optimized for improving the MAG quality in complex samples by implementing a combination of single- and co-assembly, and dereplication after binning. The exploration of the active pathways within the recovered MAGs can be visualized in ViMO, which also provides an overview of the MAG taxonomy and quality (contamination and completeness), and information about carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), as well as KEGG annotations and pathways, with counts and abundances at both mRNA and protein level. To achieve this, the metatranscriptomic reads and metaproteomic mass-spectrometry spectra are mapped onto predicted genes from the metagenome to analyse the functional potential of MAGs, as well as the actual expressed proteins and functions of the microbiome, all visualized in ViMO. Conclusion Our three workflows for integrative meta-omics in combination with ViMO presents a progression in the analysis of ‘omics data, particularly within Galaxy, but also beyond. The optimized metagenomics workflow allows for detailed reconstruction of microbial community consisting of MAGs with high quality, and thus improves analyses of the metabolism of the microbiome, using the metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics workflows.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, MAGs, Annotation","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics, (Meta)transcriptomics, Metatranscriptomics, (Meta)proteomics, Metaproteomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
249,2023,Nitrogen and sulfur cycling driven by Campylobacterota in the sediment–water interface of deep-sea cold seep: a case in the South China Sea,"ABSTRACT Chemoautotrophs within Campylobacterota, especially Sulfurovum and Sulfurimonas, are abundant in the seawater–sediment interface of the Formosa cold seep in the South China Sea. However, the in situ activity and function of Campylobacterota are unknown. In this study, the geochemical role of Campylobacterota in the Formosa cold seep was investigated with multiple means. Two members of Sulfurovum and Sulfurimonas were isolated for the first time from deep-sea cold seep. These isolates are new chemoautotrophic species that can use molecular hydrogen as an energy source and CO2 as a sole carbon source. Comparative genomics identified an important hydrogen-oxidizing cluster in Sulfurovum and Sulfurimonas. Metatranscriptomic analysis detected high expression of hydrogen-oxidizing gene in the RS, suggesting that H2 was likely an energy source in the cold seep. Genomic analysis indicated that the Sulfurovum and Sulfurimonas isolates possess a truncated sulfur-oxidizing system, and metatranscriptomic analysis revealed that Sulfurovum and Sulfurimonas with this genotype were active in the surface of RS and likely contributed to thiosulfate production. Furthermore, geochemical and in situ analyses revealed sharply decreased nitrate concentration in the sediment–water interface due to microbial consumption. Consistently, the denitrification genes of Sulfurimonas and Sulfurovum were highly expressed, suggesting an important contribution of these bacteria to nitrogen cycling. Overall, this study demonstrated that Campylobacterota played a significant role in the cycling of nitrogen and sulfur in a deep-sea cold seep. IMPORTANCE Chemoautotrophs within Campylobacterota, in particular Sulfurovum and Sulfurimonas, are ubiquitous in deep-sea cold seeps and hydrothermal vents. However, to date, no Sulfurovum or Sulfurimonas has been isolated from cold seeps, and the ecological roles of these bacteria in cold seeps remain to be investigated. In this study, we obtained two isolates of Sulfurovum and Sulfurimonas from Formosa cold seep, South China Sea. Comparative genomics, metatranscriptomics, geochemical analysis, and in situ experimental study indicated collectively that Campylobacterota played a significant part in nitrogen and sulfur cycling in cold seep and was the cause of thiosulfate accumulation and sharp reduction of nitrate level in the sediment–water interface. The findings of this study promoted our understanding of the in situ function and ecological role of deep-sea Campylobacterota.

251,2023,Recommendations for the use of metagenomics for routine monitoring of antibiotic resistance in wastewater and impacted aquatic environments,"Abstract Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of the collective genomic information carried across microbial communities is emerging as a powerful approach for monitoring antibiotic resistance in environmental matrices. Metagenomics is advantageous in that known and putative antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (i.e., the resistome) can be screened simultaneously without a priori selection of targets. Additionally, as new ARGs are discovered and catalogued, stored sequencing data can be reanalyzed to assess the prevalence of emerging genes or pathogens. However, best practices for metagenomic data generation and processing are needed to support comparability across space and time. To support reproducible downstream analysis, guidance is first needed with respect to sampling design, sample preservation and storage, DNA extraction, library preparation, sequencing depth, and experimental controls. Here we conducted a systematic review to assess current practices for the application of metagenomics for AR profiling of wastewater, recycled water, and surface water and to offer recommendations to support comparability in the collection, production, and analysis of resulting data. Based on integrated analysis of findings and data reported across 95 articles identified, a field to benchtop metagenomic workflow is discussed for optimizing the representativeness and comparability of generated data. Through the reanalysis of 1474 publicly-available metagenomes, appropriate sequencing depths per environment and uniform normalization strategies are provided. Further, there is opportunity to harness the quantitative capacity of metagenomics more overtly through inclusion of sequencing controls. The recommendations will amplify the overall value of the metagenomic data generated to support within and between study comparisons, now and in the future.

252,2023,"Inulin increases the beneficial effects of rhubarb supplementation on high-fat high-sugar diet-induced metabolic disorders in mice: impact on energy expenditure, brown adipose tissue activity, and microbiota","ABSTRACT Consumption of prebiotics and plant-based compounds have many beneficial health effects through modulation of gut microbiota composition and are considered as promising nutritional strategy for the treatment of metabolic diseases. In the present study, we assessed the separated and combined effects of inulin and rhubarb on diet-induced metabolic disease in mice. We showed that supplementation with both inulin and rhubarb abolished the total body and fat mass gain upon high-fat and high-sucrose diet (HFHS) as well as several obesity-associated metabolic disorders. These effects were associated with increased energy expenditure, lower whitening of the brown adipose tissue, higher mitochondria activity and increased expression of lipolytic markers in white adipose tissue. Despite modifications of intestinal gut microbiota and bile acid compositions by inulin or rhubarb alone, combination of both inulin and rhubarb had minor additional impact on these parameters. However, the combination of inulin and rhubarb increased the expression of several antimicrobial peptides and higher goblet cell numbers, thereby suggesting a reinforcement of the gut barrier. Together, these results suggest that the combination of inulin and rhubarb in mice potentiates beneficial effects of separated rhubarb and inulin on HFHS-related metabolic disease and could be considered as nutritional strategy for the prevention and treatment of obesity and related pathologies.",Microbiome,AMR,,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

Due to this versatility, the number of applications of this omics technology reached its horizons. Agriculture is a crucial sector involving crop plants and microorganisms interacting together. Hence, studying these interactions through the lenses of metagenomics would completely disclose a new meaning to crop health and development. The rhizosphere is an essential reservoir of the microbial community for agricultural soil. Hence, we focus on the R&D of metagenomic studies on the rhizosphere of crops such as rice, wheat, legumes, chickpea, and sorghum. These recent developments are impossible without the continuous advancement seen in the next-generation sequencing platforms; thus, a brief introduction and analysis of the available sequencing platforms are presented here to have a clear picture of the workflow. Concluding the topic is the discussion about different pipelines applied to analyze data produced by sequencing techniques and have a significant role in interpreting the outcome of a particular experiment.

254,2022,A Pilot Study: Favorable Effects of Clostridium butyricum on Intestinal Microbiota for Adjuvant Therapy of Lung Cancer,"Simple Summary A previous study has reported that the intestinal microbiota plays important roles in drug efficacy and toxicity in response to anticancer treatment. Clostridium butyricum could increase intestinal beneficial bacteria and has been clinically used in many diseases. Therefore, we tried to assess the roles of Clostridium butyricum by examining the composition, structure, diversity, marked differences, and interactional network of intestinal microbiota, as well as the progression-free survival, overall survival, and adverse events. The results showed that Clostridium butyricum supplement made some favorable changes in intestinal microbiota, such as the higher total richness of the genus Clostridium, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus, and no distinguishing opportunistic pathogenetic markers, as well as the reduction in adverse events. This makes probiotics be promising adjunctive therapeutic avenues for lung cancer. Abstract Probiotics as medications have previously been shown to change intestinal microbial characteristics, potentially influencing cancer therapy efficacy. Patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NS-NSCLC) treated by bevacizumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy were randomized to obtain Clostridium butyricum supplement (CBS) or receive a placebo as adjuvant therapy. Clinical efficacy and safety were assessed using progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events (AE). Intestinal microbiota was longitudinally explored between CBS and placebo groups over time. Patients who took CBS had significantly decreased bacterial richness and abundance, as well as increased the total richness of the genus Clostridium, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus compared to the placebo group (p < 0.05). Beta diversity and the interactional network of intestinal microbiota were distinctly different between CBS and placebo group. However, there were no significant variations between them in terms of microbial taxonomical taxa and alpha diversity. The potential opportunistic pathogen Shewanella was still detectable after treatment in the placebo group, while no distinguishing microbial markers were found in the CBS group. In terms of clinical efficacy, the CBS group had a significantly reduced AE compare to the placebo group (p < 0.05), although no significantly longer PFS and OS. Therefore, favorable modifications in intestinal microbiota and significant improvements in drug safety make probiotics be promising adjunctive therapeutic avenues for lung cancer treatment.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Interactome",,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
255,2022,An In-Silico Investigation to Design a Multi-Epitopes Vaccine against Multi-Drug Resistant Hafnia alvei,"Antimicrobial resistance has become a significant health issue because of the misuse of antibiotics in our daily lives, resulting in high rates of morbidity and mortality. Hafnia alvei is a rod-shaped, Gram-negative and facultative anaerobic bacteria. The medical community has emphasized H. alvei’s possible association with gastroenteritis. As of now, there is no licensed vaccine for H. alvei, and as such, computer aided vaccine design approaches could be an ideal approach to highlight the potential vaccine epitopes against this bacteria. By using bacterial pan-genome analysis (BPGA), we were able to study the entire proteomes of H. alvei with the aim of developing a vaccine. Based on the analysis, 20,370 proteins were identified as core proteins, which were further used in identifying potential vaccine targets based on several vaccine candidacy parameters. The prioritized vaccine targets against the bacteria are; type 1 fimbrial protein, flagellar hook length control protein (FliK), flagellar hook associated protein (FlgK), curli production assembly/transport protein (CsgF), fimbria/pilus outer membrane usher protein, fimbria/pilus outer membrane usher protein, molecular chaperone, flagellar filament capping protein (FliD), TonB-dependent hemoglobin /transferrin/lactoferrin family receptor, Porin (OmpA), flagellar basal body rod protein (FlgF) and flagellar hook-basal body complex protein (FliE). During the epitope prediction phase, different antigenic, immunogenic, non-Allergenic, and non-Toxic epitopes were predicted for the above-mentioned proteins. The selected epitopes were combined to generate a multi-epitope vaccine construct and a cholera toxin B subunit (adjuvant) was added to enhance the vaccine’s antigenicity. Downward analyses of vaccines were performed using a vaccine three-dimensional model. Docking studies have confirmed that the vaccine strongly binds with MHC-I, MHC-II, and TLR-4 immune cell receptors. Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that the vaccine epitopes were exposed to nature and to the host immune system and interpreted strong intermolecular binding between the vaccine and receptors. Based on the results of the study, the model vaccine construct seems to have the capacity to produce protective immune responses in the host, making it an attractive candidate for further in vitro and in vivo studies.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR, MAGs","(Meta)genomics, (Meta)proteomics",Health & Disease

Therefore, we conducted a prospective uncontrolled open-label study to analyze the efficacy and safety of IN for patients with UC. Methods Patients with moderate to severe active UC (clinical activity index [CAI] ≥ 8) took 2 g/day of IN for 52 weeks. CAI at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 52 and Mayo endoscopic subscore (MES) and Geboes score (GS) at weeks 0, 4, and 52 were assessed. Clinical remission (CAI ≤ 4), mucosal healing (MES ≤ 1), and histological healing (GS ≤ 1) rates at each assessment were evaluated. Overall adverse events (AEs) during study period were also evaluated. The impact of IN on mucosal microbial composition was assessed using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences. Results Thirty-three patients were enrolled. The rates of clinical remission at weeks 4, 8, and 52 were 67%, 76%, and 73%, respectively. The rates of mucosal healing at weeks 4 and 52 were 48% and 70%, respectively. AEs occurred in 17 patients (51.5%) during follow-up. Four patients (12.1%) showed severe AEs, among whom 3 manifested acute colitis. No significant alteration in the mucosal microbial composition was observed with IN treatment. Conclusions One-year treatment of moderate to severe UC with IN was effective. IN might be a promising therapeutic option for maintaining remission in UC, although the relatively high rate of AEs should be considered.",,,Metabarcoding,Health & Disease
258,2022,Engineering Macromolecular Trafficking Into the Citrus Vasculature,"The plant vasculature is a central organ for long-distance transport of nutrients and signaling molecules that coordinate vegetative and reproductive processes, and adaptation response mechanisms to biotic and abiotic stress. In angiosperms, the sieve elements are devoid of nuclei, thus depending on the companion cells for the synthesis of RNA and proteins, which constitute some of the systemic signals that coordinate these processes. Massive analysis approaches have identified proteins and RNAs that could function as long-range signals in the phloem translocation stream. The selective translocation of such molecules could occur as ribonucleoprotein complexes. A key molecule facilitating this movement in Cucurbitaceae is the phloem protein CmPP16, which can facilitate the movement of RNA and other proteins into the sieve tube. The CmPP16 ortholog in Citrus CsPP16 was characterized in silico to determine its potential capacity to associate with other mobile proteins and its enrichment in the vascular tissue. The systemic nature of CsPP16 was approached by evaluating its capacity to provide phloem-mobile properties to antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), important in the innate immune defense. The engineering of macromolecular trafficking in the vasculature demonstrated the capacity to mobilize translationally fused peptides into the phloem stream for long-distance transport. The translocation into the phloem of AMPs could mitigate the growth of Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, with important implications for crop defense; this system also opens the possibility of translocating other molecules to modulate traits, such as plant growth, defense, and plant productivity.",,"Functional analysis, AMR",,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
259,2021,Gastric microbiota in patients with Helicobacter pylori-negative gastric MALT lymphoma,"Abstract To investigate the mucosal microbiota in the stomach of patients with Helicobacter pylori-negative mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma by means of metagenomic analysis. Although some gastric MALT lymphomas are associated with the presence of H. pylori, other gastric MALT lymphomas occur independently of H. pylori infection. The pathogenesis of H. pylori-negative MALT lymphoma remains unclear. Mucosal biopsy specimens were collected from the gastric body from 33 MALT lymphoma patients with gastric lesions, including both H. pylori-infection naïve patients and posteradication patients, as well as 27 control participants without H. pylori infection or cancer. Subsequently, the samples were subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Quantitative insights into microbial ecology, linear discriminant analysis effect size, and phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states softwares were used to analyze the participants’ microbiota. H. pylori-negative MALT lymphoma patients had significantly lower alpha diversity (P = .04), compared with control participants. Significant differences were evident in the microbial composition (P = .04), as determined by comparison of beta diversity between the 2 groups. Taxonomic composition analysis indicated that the genera Burkholderia and Sphingomonas were significantly more abundant in MALT lymphoma patients, while the genera Prevotella and Veillonella were less abundant. Functional microbiota prediction showed that the predicted gene pathways “replication and repair,” “translation,” and “nucleotide metabolism” were downregulated in MALT lymphoma patients. H. pylori-negative MALT lymphoma patients exhibited altered gastric mucosal microbial compositions, suggesting that altered microbiota might be involved in the pathogenesis of H. pylori-negative MALT lymphoma.","Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

261,2021,"Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Prokaryotic and Viral Community Assemblages in a Lotic System (Manatee Springs, Florida)","Prokaryotic and viral communities are central to food webs and biogeochemical processes in aquatic environments, where they help maintain ecosystem health. The Floridan aquifer system (FAS), which is the primary drinking water source for millions of people in the southeastern United States, contributes large amounts of freshwater to major river systems in Florida through its springs. ABSTRACT Flow from high-magnitude springs fed by the Floridan aquifer system contributes hundreds of liters of water per second to rivers, creating unique lotic systems. Despite their importance as freshwater sources and their contributions to the state’s major rivers, little is known about the composition and spatiotemporal variability of prokaryotic and viral communities of these spring systems or their influence on downstream river sites. At four time points throughout a year, we determined the abundance and diversity of prokaryotic and viral communities at three sites within the first-magnitude Manatee Springs system (the spring head where water emerges from the aquifer, a mixed region where the spring run ends, and a downstream site in the Suwannee River). The abundance of prokaryotes and virus-like particles increased 100-fold from the spring head to the river and few members from the head communities persisted in the river at low abundance, suggesting the springs play a minor role in seeding downstream communities. Prokaryotic and viral communities within Manatee Springs clustered by site, with seasonal variability likely driven by flow. As water flowed through the system, microbial community composition was affected by changes in physiochemical parameters and community coalescence. Evidence of species sorting and mass effects could be seen in the assemblages. Greater temporal fluctuations were observed in prokaryotic and viral community composition with increasing distance from the spring outflow, reflecting the relative stability of the groundwater environment, and comparisons to springs from prior work reaffirmed that distinct first-magnitude springs support unique communities. IMPORTANCE Prokaryotic and viral communities are central to food webs and biogeochemical processes in aquatic environments, where they help maintain ecosystem health. The Floridan aquifer system (FAS), which is the primary drinking water source for millions of people in the southeastern United States, contributes large amounts of freshwater to major river systems in Florida through its springs. However, there is a paucity of information regarding the spatiotemporal dynamics of microbial communities in these essential flowing freshwater systems. This work explored the prokaryotic and viral communities in a first-magnitude spring system fed by the FAS that discharges millions of liters of water per day into the Suwannee River. This study examined microbial community composition through space and time as well as the environmental parameters and metacommunity assembly mechanisms that shape these communities, providing a foundational understanding for monitoring future changes.","Bacteria, Virus, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, MAGs",,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
262,2021,Microbial Functional Responses Explain Alpine Soil Carbon Fluxes under Future Climate Scenarios,"The warming pace in the Tibetan Plateau, which is predominantly occupied by grassland ecosystems, has been 0.2°C per decade in recent years, dwarfing the rate of global warming by a factor of 2. Many Earth system models project substantial carbon sequestration in Tibet, which has been observed. ABSTRACT Soil microorganisms are sensitive to temperature in cold ecosystems, but it remains unclear how microbial responses are modulated by other important climate drivers, such as precipitation changes. Here, we examine the effects of six in situ warming and/or precipitation treatments in alpine grasslands on microbial communities, plants, and soil carbon fluxes. These treatments differentially affected soil carbon fluxes, gross primary production, and microbial communities. Variations of soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes across all sites significantly (r > 0.70, P < 0.050) correlated with relevant microbial functional abundances but not bacterial or fungal abundances. Given tight linkages between microbial functional traits and ecosystem functionality, we conclude that future soil carbon fluxes in alpine grasslands can be predicted by microbial carbon-degrading capacities. IMPORTANCE The warming pace in the Tibetan Plateau, which is predominantly occupied by grassland ecosystems, has been 0.2°C per decade in recent years, dwarfing the rate of global warming by a factor of 2. Many Earth system models project substantial carbon sequestration in Tibet, which has been observed. Here, we analyzed microbial communities under projected climate changes by 2100. As the soil “carbon pump,” the growth and activity of microorganisms can largely influence soil carbon dynamics. However, microbial gene response to future climate scenarios is still obscure. We showed that the abundances of microbial functional genes, but not microbial taxonomy, were correlated with carbon fluxes and ecosystem multifunctionality. By identifying microbial traits linking to ecosystem functioning, our results can guide the assessment of future soil carbon fluxes in alpine grasslands, a critical step toward mitigating climate changes.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis",,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
263,2021,ASaiM-MT: a validated and optimized ASaiM workflow for metatranscriptomics analysis within Galaxy framework,"The Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) aided in understanding the role of microbial communities and the influence of collective genetic material (the ‘microbiome’) and microbial diversity patterns across the habitats of our planet. With the evolution of new sequencing technologies, researchers can now investigate the microbiome and map its influence on the environment and human health. Advances in bioinformatics methods for next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis have helped researchers to gain an in-depth knowledge about the taxonomic and genetic composition of microbial communities. Metagenomic-based methods have been the most commonly used approaches for microbiome analysis; however, it primarily extracts information about taxonomic composition and genetic potential of the microbiome under study, lacking quantification of the gene products (RNA and proteins). On the other hand, metatranscriptomics, the study of a microbial community’s RNA expression, can reveal the dynamic gene expression of individual microbial populations and the community as a whole, ultimately providing information about the active pathways in the microbiome. In order to address the analysis of NGS data, the ASaiM analysis framework was previously developed and made available via the Galaxy platform. Although developed for both metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, the original publication demonstrated the use of ASaiM only for metagenomics, while thorough testing for metatranscriptomics data was lacking. In the current study, we have focused on validating and optimizing the tools within ASaiM for metatranscriptomics data. As a result, we deliver a robust workflow that will enable researchers to understand dynamic functional response of the microbiome in a wide variety of metatranscriptomics studies. This improved and optimized ASaiM-metatranscriptomics (ASaiM-MT) workflow is publicly available via the ASaiM framework, documented and supported with training material so that users can interrogate and characterize metatranscriptomic data, as part of larger meta-omic studies of microbiomes.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics, (Meta)transcriptomics, Metatranscriptomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
264,2021,Plant ARGONAUTE Protein Immunopurification for Pathogen Cross Kingdom Small RNA Analysis.,"Over the last decade, it has been noticed that microbial pathogens and pests deliver small RNA (sRNA) effectors into their host plants to manipulate plant physiology and immunity for infection, known as cross kingdom RNA interference. In this process, fungal and oomycete parasite sRNAs hijack the plant ARGONAUTE (AGO)/RNA-induced silencing complex to post-transcriptionally silence host target genes. We hereby describe the methodological details of how we recovered cross kingdom sRNA effectors of the oomycete pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis during infection of its host plant Arabidopsis thaliana. This Bio-protocol contains two parts: first, a detailed description on the procedure of plant AGO/sRNA co-immunopurification and sRNA recovery for Illumina high throughput sequencing analysis.

265,2021,metaXplor: an interactive viral and microbial metagenomic data manager,"Abstract Background Efficiently managing large, heterogeneous data in a structured yet flexible way is a challenge to research laboratories working with genomic data. Specifically regarding both shotgun- and metabarcoding-based metagenomics, while online reference databases and user-friendly tools exist for running various types of analyses (e.g., Qiime, Mothur, Megan, IMG/VR, Anvi'o, Qiita, MetaVir), scientists lack comprehensive software for easily building scalable, searchable, online data repositories on which they can rely during their ongoing research. Results metaXplor is a scalable, distributable, fully web-interfaced application for managing, sharing, and exploring metagenomic data. Being based on a flexible NoSQL data model, it has few constraints regarding dataset contents and thus proves useful for handling outputs from both shotgun and metabarcoding techniques. By supporting incremental data feeding and providing means to combine filters on all imported fields, it allows for exhaustive content browsing, as well as rapid narrowing to find specific records. The application also features various interactive data visualization tools, ways to query contents by BLASTing external sequences, and an integrated pipeline to enrich assignments with phylogenetic placements. The project home page provides the URL of a live instance allowing users to test the system on public data. Conclusion metaXplor allows efficient management and exploration of metagenomic data.

266,2020,Mini Review: Clinical Routine Microbiology in the Era of Automation and Digital Health,"Clinical microbiology laboratories are the first line to combat and handle infectious diseases and antibiotic resistance, including newly emerging ones. Although most clinical laboratories still rely on conventional methods, a cascade of technological changes, driven by digital imaging and high-throughput sequencing, will revolutionize the management of clinical diagnostics for direct detection of bacteria and swift antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Importantly, such technological advancements occur in the golden age of machine learning where computers are no longer acting passively in data mining, but once trained, can also help physicians in making decisions for diagnostics and optimal treatment administration. The further potential of physically integrating new technologies in an automation chain, combined to machine-learning-based software for data analyses, is seducing and would indeed lead to a faster management in infectious diseases. However, if, from one side, technological advancement would achieve a better performance than conventional methods, on the other side, this evolution challenges clinicians in terms of data interpretation and impacts the entire hospital personnel organization and management. In this mini review, we discuss such technological achievements offering practical examples of their operability but also their limitations and potential issues that their implementation could rise in clinical microbiology laboratories.",Bacteria,AMR,Imaging,Health & Disease
267,2020,A quantitative framework reveals ecological drivers of grassland microbial community assembly in response to warming,"Unraveling the drivers controlling community assembly is a central issue in ecology. Although it is generally accepted that selection, dispersal, diversification and drift are major community assembly processes, defining their relative importance is very challenging. Here, we present a framework to quantitatively infer community assembly mechanisms by phylogenetic bin-based null model analysis (iCAMP). iCAMP shows high accuracy (0.93–0.99), precision (0.80–0.94), sensitivity (0.82–0.94), and specificity (0.95–0.98) on simulated communities, which are 10–160% higher than those from the entire community-based approach. Application of iCAMP to grassland microbial communities in response to experimental warming reveals dominant roles of homogeneous selection (38%) and ‘drift’ (59%). Interestingly, warming decreases ‘drift’ over time, and enhances homogeneous selection which is primarily imposed on Bacillales. In addition, homogeneous selection has higher correlations with drought and plant productivity under warming than control. iCAMP provides an effective and robust tool to quantify microbial assembly processes, and should also be useful for plant and animal ecology. Studies of microbial community assembly mechanisms typically use metrics for turnover within the whole community. Here, the authors develop an alternative approach based on turnover within lineages and dissect mechanistic change in grassland bacterial assembly under experimental warming.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, MAGs",,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
268,2020,"Prokaryotic and Viral Community Composition of Freshwater Springs in Florida, USA","Aquifer systems may hold up to 40% of the total microbial biomass on Earth. However, little is known about the composition of microbial communities within these critical freshwater ecosystems. Here, we took advantage of Florida’s first-magnitude springs (the highest spring classification based on water discharge), each discharging at least 246 million liters of water each day from the Floridan aquifer system (FAS), to investigate prokaryotic and viral communities from the aquifer. The FAS serves as a major source of potable water in the Southeastern United States, providing water for large cities and citizens in three states. Unfortunately, the health of the FAS and its associated springs has declined in the past few decades due to nutrient loading, increased urbanization and agricultural activity in aquifer recharge zones, and saltwater intrusion. This is the first study to describe the prokaryotic and viral communities in Florida’s first-magnitude springs, providing a baseline against which to compare future ecosystem change. ABSTRACT Aquifers, which are essential underground freshwater reservoirs worldwide, are understudied ecosystems that harbor diverse forms of microbial life. This study investigated the abundance and composition of prokaryotic and viral communities in the outflow of five springs across northern Florida, USA, as a proxy of microbial communities found in one of the most productive aquifers in the world, the Floridan aquifer. The average abundances of virus-like particles and prokaryotic cells were slightly lower than those reported from other groundwater systems, ranging from 9.6 × 103 ml−1 to 1.1 × 105 ml−1 and 2.2 × 103 ml−1 to 3.4 × 104 ml−1, respectively. Despite all of the springs being fed by the Floridan aquifer, sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and viral metagenomes (viromes) revealed unique communities in each spring, suggesting that groundwater microbial communities are influenced by land usage in recharge zones. The prokaryotic communities were dominated by Bacteria, and though the most abundant phyla (Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and Bacteroidetes) were found in relatively high abundance across springs, variation was seen at finer taxonomic resolution. The viral sequences were most similar to those described from other aquatic environments. Sequencing resulted in the completion of 58 novel viral genomes representing members of the order Caudovirales as well as prokaryotic and eukaryotic single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses. Sequences similar to those of ssDNA viruses were detected at all spring sites and dominated the identifiable sequences at one spring site, showing that these small viruses merit further investigation in groundwater systems. IMPORTANCE Aquifer systems may hold up to 40% of the total microbial biomass on Earth.

270,2020,Specialization of mucosal immunoglobulins in pathogen control and microbiota homeostasis occurred early in vertebrate evolution,"Mucosal immunoglobulins of primitive and modern vertebrates evolved to control pathogens and preserve microbiota homeostasis. Managing microbiota to a T Mucosal surfaces in teleost fish harbor B cells that produce IgT, a secretory mucosal immunoglobulin. To investigate how IgT influences gill microbiota composition and resistance to infection, Xu et al. developed an efficient technique for temporarily depleting IgT-producing B cells in rainbow trout. Acute induction of IgT deficiency in trout led to dysbiosis of commensal gill microbiota, inflammation, tissue damage, and impaired resistance to infection by a mucosal parasite. The gill pathology triggered by loss of IgT was reversible after IgT levels recovered to the normal range. These findings demonstrate that the mucosal immunoglobulin species in both teleost fish (IgT) and mammals (mostly IgA) play evolutionarily conserved roles in the maintenance of healthy commensal microbiota communities and control of pathogens. Although mammalian secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) targets mucosal pathogens for elimination, its interaction with the microbiota also enables commensal colonization and homeostasis. This paradoxical requirement in the control of pathogens versus microbiota raised the question of whether mucosal (secretory) Igs (sIgs) evolved primarily to protect mucosal surfaces from pathogens or to maintain microbiome homeostasis. To address this central question, we used a primitive vertebrate species (rainbow trout) in which we temporarily depleted its mucosal Ig (sIgT). Fish devoid of sIgT became highly susceptible to a mucosal parasite and failed to develop compensatory IgM responses against it. IgT depletion also induced a profound dysbiosis marked by the loss of sIgT-coated beneficial taxa, expansion of pathobionts, tissue damage, and inflammation. Restitution of sIgT levels in IgT-depleted fish led to a reversal of microbial translocation and tissue damage, as well as to restoration of microbiome homeostasis. Our findings indicate that specialization of sIgs in pathogen and microbiota control occurred concurrently early in evolution, thus revealing primordially conserved principles under which primitive and modern sIgs operate in the control of microbes at mucosal surfaces.","Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Interactome, AMR",,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
271,2020,Mucosal dysbiosis in patients with gastrointestinal follicular lymphoma,"Because the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal follicular lymphoma (GI‐FL) remains unclear, no standardized treatment strategy has been established. Of the gastrointestinal lymphomas, gastric mucosa‐associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas are strongly associated with Helicobacter pylori; hence, the microbiota may be involved in GI‐FL pathogenesis. However, the association between GI‐FL and the microbiota remains uninvestigated. Therefore, we compared the mucosal microbiotas of GI‐FL patients with those of controls to identify microbiota changes in GI‐FL patients. Mucosal biopsy samples were obtained from the second portion of the duodenum from 20 GI‐FL patients with duodenal lesions and 20 controls. Subsequent 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on these samples. QIIME pipeline and LEfSe software were used to analyze the microbiota. The GI‐FL patients had significantly lower alpha diversity (P = .049) than did the controls, with significant differences in the microbial composition (P = .023) evaluated by the beta diversity metrics between the two groups. Comparing the taxonomic compositions indicated that the genera Sporomusa, Rothia, and Prevotella and the family Gemellaceae were significantly less abundant in the GI‐FL patients than in the controls. GI‐FL patients presented altered duodenal mucosal microbial compositions, suggesting that the microbiota might be involved in the GI‐FL pathogenesis.","Microbiome, Pathogen",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
272,2019,Commensal bacteria regulate gene expression and differentiation in vertebrate olfactory systems through transcription factor REST.,"Sensory systems such as the olfactory system detect chemical stimuli and thereby determine the relationships between the animal and its surroundings. Olfaction is one of the most conserved and ancient sensory systems in vertebrates. The vertebrate olfactory epithelium is colonized by complex microbial communities, but microbial contribution to host olfactory gene expression remains unknown. In this study, we show that colonization of germ-free zebrafish and mice with microbiota leads to widespread transcriptional responses in olfactory organs as measured in bulk tissue transcriptomics and RT-qPCR. Germ-free zebrafish olfactory epithelium showed defects in pseudostratification, however the size of the olfactory pit and the length of the cilia was not different from that of colonized zebrafish. One of the mechanisms by which microbiota control host transcriptional programs is by differential expression and activity of specific transcription factors. REST (RE1 silencing transcription factor, also called NRSF) is a zinc finger transcription factor that binds to the conserved motif repressor element 1 found in the promoter regions of many neuronal genes with functions in neuronal development and differentiation. Colonized zebrafish and mice showed increased nasal expression of REST, and genes with reduced expression in colonized animals were strongly enriched in REST binding motifs. Nasal commensal bacteria promoted in vitro differentiation of Odora cells by regulating the kinetics of REST expression. REST knockdown resulted in decreased Odora cell differentiation in vitro. Our results identify a conserved mechanism by which microbiota regulate vertebrate olfactory transcriptional programs and reveal a new role for REST in sensory organs.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis",(Meta)transcriptomics,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
273,2019,"Temporal, Environmental, and Biological Drivers of the Mucosal Microbiome in a Wild Marine Fish, Scomber japonicus","Pacific chub mackerel, Scomber japonicus, are one of the largest and most economically important fisheries in the world. The fish is harvested for both human consumption and fish meal. Changing ocean conditions driven by anthropogenic stressors like climate change may negatively impact fisheries. One mechanism for this is through disease. As waters warm and chemistry changes, the microbial communities associated with fish may change. In this study, we performed a holistic analysis of all mucosal sites on the fish over a 1-year time series to explore seasonal variation and to understand the environmental drivers of the microbiome. Understanding seasonality in the fish microbiome is also applicable to aquaculture production for producers to better understand and predict when disease outbreaks may occur based on changing environmental conditions in the ocean. ABSTRACT Changing ocean conditions driven by anthropogenic activities may have a negative impact on fisheries by increasing stress and disease. To understand how environment and host biology drives mucosal microbiomes in a marine fish, we surveyed five body sites (gill, skin, digesta, gastrointestinal tract [GI], and pyloric ceca) from 229 Pacific chub mackerel, Scomber japonicus, collected across 38 time points spanning 1 year from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography Pier (La Jolla, CA). Mucosal sites had unique microbial communities significantly different from the surrounding seawater and sediment communities with over 10 times more total diversity than seawater. The external surfaces of skin and gill were more similar to seawater, while digesta was more similar to sediment. Alpha and beta diversity of the skin and gill was explained by environmental and biological factors, specifically, sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a, and fish age, consistent with an exposure gradient relationship. We verified that seasonal microbial changes were not confounded by regional migration of chub mackerel subpopulations by nanopore sequencing a 14,769-bp region of the 16,568-bp mitochondria across all temporal fish specimens. A cosmopolitan pathogen, Photobacterium damselae, was prevalent across multiple body sites all year but highest in the skin, GI, and digesta between June and September, when the ocean is warmest. The longitudinal fish microbiome study evaluates the extent to which the environment and host biology drives mucosal microbial ecology and establishes a baseline for long-term surveys linking environment stressors to mucosal health of wild marine fish. IMPORTANCE Pacific chub mackerel, Scomber japonicus, are one of the largest and most economically important fisheries in the world. The fish is harvested for both human consumption and fish meal. Changing ocean conditions driven by anthropogenic stressors like climate change may negatively impact fisheries. One mechanism for this is through disease.

While software for detailing the composition of microbial communities using 16S rRNA marker genes is relatively mature, increasingly researchers are interested in identifying changes exhibited within microbial communities under differing environmental conditions. In order to gain maximum value from metagenomic sequence data we must improve the existing analysis environment by providing accessible and scalable computational workflows able to generate reproducible results. Here we describe a complete end-to-end open-source metagenomics workflow running within Galaxy for 16S differential abundance analysis. The workflow accepts 454 or Illumina sequence data (either overlapping or non-overlapping paired end reads) and outputs lists of the operational taxonomic unit (OTUs) exhibiting the greatest change under differing conditions. A range of analysis steps and graphing options are available giving users a high-level of control over their data and analyses. Additionally, users are able to input complex sample-specific metadata information which can be incorporated into differential analysis and used for grouping / colouring within graphs. Detailed tutorials containing sample data and existing workflows are available for three different input types: overlapping and non-overlapping read pairs as well as for pre-generated Biological Observation Matrix (BIOM) files.

Though V. parahaemolyticus is predominantly environmental, some strains have infected human hosts and caused outbreaks of seafood-related gastroenteritis. In order to understand differences among clinical and environmental V. parahaemolyticus strains, we used high quality DNA sequencing data to compare the genomes of V. parahaemolyticus isolates (n = 43) from a variety of geographic locations and clinical and environmental sample matrices. We used phylogenetic trees inferred from multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and whole-genome (WG) alignments, as well as a novel classification and genome clustering approach that relies on protein motif fingerprints (MFs), to assess relationships between V. parahaemolyticus strains and identify novel molecular targets associated with virulence. Differences in strain clustering at more than one position were observed between the MLST and WG phylogenetic trees. The WG phylogeny had higher support values and strain resolution since isolates of the same sequence type could be differentiated. The MF analysis revealed groups of protein motifs that were associated with the pathogenic MLST type ST36 and a large group of clinical strains isolated from human stool. A subset of the stool and ST36-associated protein motifs were selected for further analysis and the motif sequences were found in genes with a variety of functions, including transposases, secretion system components and effectors, and hypothetical proteins.

278,2018,The Integrated Rapid Infectious Disease Analysis (IRIDA) Platform,"Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a powerful tool for public health infectious disease investigations owing to its higher resolution, greater efficiency, and cost-effectiveness over traditional genotyping methods. Implementation of WGS in routine public health microbiology laboratories is impeded by a lack of user-friendly automated and semi-automated pipelines, restrictive jurisdictional data sharing policies, and the proliferation of non-interoperable analytical and reporting systems. To address these issues, we developed the Integrated Rapid Infectious Disease Analysis (IRIDA) platform (irida.ca), a user-friendly, decentralized, open-source bioinformatics and analytical web platform to support real-time infectious disease outbreak investigations using WGS data. Instances can be independently installed on local high-performance computing infrastructure, enabling private and secure data management and analyses according to organizational policies and governance. IRIDA’s data management capabilities enable secure upload, storage and sharing of all WGS data and metadata. The core platform currently includes pipelines for quality control, assembly, annotation, variant detection, phylogenetic analysis, in silico serotyping, multi-locus sequence typing, and genome distance calculation. Analysis pipeline results can be visualized within the platform through dynamic line lists and integrated phylogenomic clustering for research and discovery, and for enhancing decision-making support and hypothesis generation in epidemiological investigations. Communication and data exchange between instances are provided through customizable access controls. IRIDA complements centralized systems, empowering local analytics and visualizations for genomics-based microbial pathogen investigations. IRIDA is currently transforming the Canadian public health ecosystem and is freely available at https://github.com/phac-nml/irida and www.irida.ca. Impact Statement Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is revolutionizing infectious disease analysis and surveillance due to its cost effectiveness, utility, and improved analytical power. To date, no “one-size-fits-all” genomics platform has been universally adopted, owing to differences in national (and regional) health information systems, data sharing policies, computational infrastructures, lack of interoperability and prohibitive costs. The Integrated Rapid Infectious Disease Analysis (IRIDA) platform is a user-friendly, decentralized, open-source bioinformatics and analytical web platform developed to support real-time infectious disease outbreak investigations using WGS data. IRIDA empowers public health, regulatory and clinical microbiology laboratory personnel to better incorporate WGS technology into routine operations by shielding them from the computational and analytical complexities of big data genomics. IRIDA is now routinely used as part of a validated suite of tools to support outbreak investigations in Canada. While IRIDA was designed to serve the needs of the Canadian public health system, it is generally applicable to any public health and multi-jurisdictional environment. IRIDA enables localized analyses but provides mechanisms and standard outputs to enable data sharing. This approach can help overcome pervasive challenges in real-time global infectious disease surveillance, investigation and control, resulting in faster responses, and ultimately, better public health outcomes.

279,2018,Exploring temporal patterns of bacterial and fungal DNA accumulation on a ventilation system filter for a Singapore university library,"Introduction Ventilation system filters process recirculated indoor air along with outdoor air. This function inspires the idea of using the filter as an indoor bioaerosol sampler. While promising, there remains a need to investigate several factors that could limit the accuracy of such a sampling approach. Among the important factors are the dynamics of microbial assemblages on filter surfaces over time and the differential influence of outdoor versus recirculated indoor air. Methods This study collected ventilation system filter samples from an air handling unit on a regular schedule over a 21-week period and analyzed the accumulation patterns of biological particles on the filter both quantitatively (using fluorometry and qPCR) and in terms of microbial diversity (using 16S rDNA and ITS sequencing). Results The quantitative result showed that total and bacterial DNA accumulated monotonically, rising to 41 ng/cm2 for total DNA and to 2.8 ng/cm2 for bacterial DNA over the 21-week period. The accumulation rate of bacterial DNA correlated with indoor occupancy level. Fungal DNA first rose to 4.0 ng/cm2 before showing a dip to 1.4 ng/cm2 between weeks 6 and 10. The dip indicated a possible artifact of this sampling approach for quantitative analysis as DNA may not be conserved on the filter over the months-long service period. The sequencing results indicate major contributions from outdoor air for fungi and from recirculated indoor air for bacteria. Despite the quantitative changes, the community structure of the microbial assemblages was stable throughout the 21-week sampling period, highlighting the robustness of this sampling method for microbial profiling. Conclusion This study supports the use of ventilation system filters as indoor bioaerosol samplers, but with caveats: 1) an outdoor reference is required to properly understand the contribution of outdoor bioaerosols; and 2) there is a need to better understand the persistence and durability of the targeted organisms on ventilation system filters.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis",Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

Metagenomic sequencing was conducted on eight composite fecal samples originating from four beef cattle feedlots. Metagenomic DNA was sequenced to various depths, D1, D0.5 and D0.25, with average sample read counts of 117, 59 and 26 million, respectively. A comparative analysis of the relative abundance of reads aligning to different phyla and antimicrobial classes indicated that the relative proportions of read assignments remained fairly constant regardless of depth. However, the number of reads being assigned to ARGs as well as to microbial taxa increased significantly with increasing depth. We found a depth of D0.5 was suitable to describe the microbiome and resistome of cattle fecal samples.

Results Based on accumulated biomass, average DNA concentrations per AHU filter surface area across nine indoor locations after twelve weeks of filter use were in the respective ranges 1.1 to 41 ng per cm2 for total DNA, 0.02 to 3.3 ng per cm2 for bacterial DNA and 0.2 to 2.0 ng DNA per cm2 for fungal DNA. The most abundant genera detected on the AHU filter samples were Clostridium, Streptophyta, Bacillus, Acinetobacter and Ktedonobacter for bacteria and Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Nigrospora, Rigidoporus and Lentinus for fungi. Conditional indoor airborne DNA concentrations (median (range)) were estimated to be 13 (2.6–107) pg/m3 for total DNA, 0.4 (0.05–8.4) pg/m3 for bacterial DNA and 2.3 (1.0–5.1) pg/m3 for fungal DNA. Conclusion Conditional airborne concentrations and the relative abundances of selected groups of genera correlate well with occupancy level. Bacterial DNA was found to be more responsive than fungal DNA to differences in occupancy level and indoor environmental conditions.",Bacteria,Community (taxonomy) profiling,,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
282,2017,Salmonid alphavirus infection causes skin dysbiosis in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) post-smolts,"Interactions among host, microbiota and viral pathogens are complex and poorly understood. The goal of the present study is to assess the changes in the skin microbial community of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) in response to experimental infection with salmonid alphavirus (SAV). The salmon skin microbial community was determined using 16S rDNA pyrosequencing in five different experimental groups: control, 7 days after infection with low-dose SAV, 14 days after infection with low-dose SAV, 7 days after infection with high-dose SAV, and 14 days after infection with high-dose SAV. Both infection treatment and time after infection were strong predictors of the skin microbial community composition. Skin samples from SAV3 infected fish showed an unbalanced microbiota characterized by a decreased abundance of Proteobacteria such as Oleispira sp. and increased abundances of opportunistic taxa including Flavobacteriaceae, Streptococcaceae and Tenacibaculum sp. These results demonstrate that viral infections can result in skin dysbiosis likely rendering the host more susceptible to secondary bacterial infections.","Bacteria, Virus, Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Interactome",Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
283,2016,MEGARes: an antimicrobial resistance database for high throughput sequencing,"Antimicrobial resistance has become an imminent concern for public health. As methods for detection and characterization of antimicrobial resistance move from targeted culture and polymerase chain reaction to high throughput metagenomics, appropriate resources for the analysis of large-scale data are required. Currently, antimicrobial resistance databases are tailored to smaller-scale, functional profiling of genes using highly descriptive annotations. Such characteristics do not facilitate the analysis of large-scale, ecological sequence datasets such as those produced with the use of metagenomics for surveillance. In order to overcome these limitations, we present MEGARes (https://megares.meglab.org), a hand-curated antimicrobial resistance database and annotation structure that provides a foundation for the development of high throughput acyclical classifiers and hierarchical statistical analysis of big data. MEGARes can be browsed as a stand-alone resource through the website or can be easily integrated into sequence analysis pipelines through download. Also via the website, we provide documentation for AmrPlusPlus, a user-friendly Galaxy pipeline for the analysis of high throughput sequencing data that is pre-packaged for use with the MEGARes database.",,"Functional analysis, AMR, Annotation","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

285,2016,Quantifying the Sensitivity of Soil Microbial Communities to Silver Sulfide Nanoparticles Using Metagenome Sequencing,"Soils are a sink for sulfidised-silver nanoparticles (Ag2S-NPs), yet there are limited ecotoxicity data for their effects on microbial communities. Conventional toxicity tests typically target a single test species or function, which does not reflect the broader community response. Using a combination of quantitative PCR, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and species sensitivity distribution (SSD) methods, we have developed a new approach to calculate silver-based NP toxicity thresholds (HCx, hazardous concentrations) that are protective of specific members (operational taxonomic units, OTUs) of the soil microbial community. At the HC20 (80% of species protected), soil OTUs were significantly less sensitive to Ag2S-NPs compared to AgNPs and Ag+ (5.9, 1.4 and 1.4 mg Ag kg-1, respectively). However at more conservative HC values, there were no significant differences. These trends in OTU responses matched with those seen in a specific microbial function (rate of nitrification) and amoA-bacteria gene abundance. This study provides a novel molecular-based framework for quantifying the effect of a toxicant on whole soil microbial communities while still determining sensitive genera/species. Methods and results described here provide a benchmark for microbial community ecotoxicological studies and we recommend that future revisions of Soil Quality Guidelines for AgNPs and other such toxicants consider this approach.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
286,2014,CopyRighter: a rapid tool for improving the accuracy of microbial community profiles through lineage-specific gene copy number correction,"BackgroundCulture-independent molecular surveys targeting conserved marker genes, most notably 16S rRNA, to assess microbial diversity remain semi-quantitative due to variations in the number of gene copies between species.ResultsBased on 2,900 sequenced reference genomes, we show that 16S rRNA gene copy number (GCN) is strongly linked to microbial phylogenetic taxonomy, potentially under-representing Archaea in amplicon microbial profiles. Using this relationship, we inferred the GCN of all bacterial and archaeal lineages in the Greengenes database within a phylogenetic framework. We created CopyRighter, new software which uses these estimates to correct 16S rRNA amplicon microbial profiles and associated quantitative (q)PCR total abundance. CopyRighter parses microbial profiles and, because GCN estimates are pre-computed for all taxa in the reference taxonomy, rapidly corrects GCN bias. Software validation with in silico and in vitro mock communities indicated that GCN correction results in more accurate estimates of microbial relative abundance and improves the agreement between metagenomic and amplicon profiles. Analyses of human-associated and anaerobic digester microbiomes illustrate that correction makes tangible changes to estimates of qPCR total abundance, α and β diversity, and can significantly change biological interpretation. For example, human gut microbiomes from twins were reclassified into three rather than two enterotypes after GCN correction.ConclusionsThe CopyRighter bioinformatic tools permits rapid correction of GCN in microbial surveys, resulting in improved estimates of microbial abundance, α and β diversity.","Bacteria, Archaea, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,"Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
287,2012,"Gene discovery from a pilot study of the transcriptomes from three diverse microbial eukaryotes: Corallomyxa tenera, Chilodonella uncinata, and Subulatomonas tetraspora","Background: Characterizing genome-scale data from diverse eukaryotes is essential for gene discovery and for inferring major transitions across the eukaryotic tree of life. Yet, the bulk of eukaryotic diversity remains undersampled, particularly for free-living microbial lineages. Analysis of transcriptome data generated from high throughput (e.g. 454) sequencing of mRNAs provides an efficient way to characterize genes from diverse eukaryotes. Results: Here we report analyses of RNA-Seq data from the rhizarian net-like amoeba Corallomyxa tenera, the ciliate Chilodonella uncinata and a recently-described genus representing a novel major clade of eukaryotes, Subulatomonas tetraspora. We generated 16,983, 11,529 and 10,630 contigs plus single reads for these taxa respectively. Given that these organisms cannot be cultured axenically, we developed custom scripts to remove bacterial contaminants through an iterative BLAST based protocol and we then identified expressed genes using BLAST2GO (1;2). This approach yielded a large number of genes with eukaryotic homologs, as well as numerous novel genes. To assess our approach and to explore the resulting sequences, we searched for genes involved in anaerobic metabolism, RNAi and meiosis. Further, we report the results of a preliminary phylogenomic analysis including these organisms. Conclusions: We characterized the transcriptomes of three phylogenetically diverse eukaryotes. After applying several filters to ensure the retention of only high-quality, non-contaminant data, we identified numerous sequences that can be used for gene discovery and phylogenomics. We found candidate genes involved in RNAi, meiosis, and anaerobic metabolism, and generated phylogenies that place the target taxa in positions predicted by previous analyses. This work supports the use of high throughput approaches for assessing features of non-model organisms, even in instances when species cannot be cultured axenically or grown to large numbers.","Bacteria, Eukaryote",Community (taxonomy) profiling,"(Meta)genomics, (Meta)transcriptomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

289,2010,A Primer on Metagenomics,"Metagenomics is a discipline that enables the genomic study of uncultured microorganisms. Faster, cheaper sequencing technologies and the ability to sequence uncultured microbes sampled directly from their habitats are expanding and transforming our view of the microbial world. Distilling meaningful information from the millions of new genomic sequences presents a serious challenge to bioinformaticians. In cultured microbes, the genomic data come from a single clone, making sequence assembly and annotation tractable. In metagenomics, the data come from heterogeneous microbial communities, sometimes containing more than 10,000 species, with the sequence data being noisy and partial. From sampling, to assembly, to gene calling and function prediction, bioinformatics faces new demands in interpreting voluminous, noisy, and often partial sequence data. Although metagenomics is a relative newcomer to science, the past few years have seen an explosion in computational methods applied to metagenomic-based research. It is therefore not within the scope of this article to provide an exhaustive review. Rather, we provide here a concise yet comprehensive introduction to the current computational requirements presented by metagenomics, and review the recent progress made. We also note whether there is software that implements any of the methods presented here, and briefly review its utility. Nevertheless, it would be useful if readers of this article would avail themselves of the comment section provided by this journal, and relate their own experiences.

292,2025,Skin but not gut microbial communities in Antarctic fur seals vary with social density,"Comparative studies of microbial communities occupying different body sites in wild vertebrates are scarce, but they are crucial for advancing our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary factors shaping animal microbiomes. We therefore used a “natural experiment” comprising mother-offspring pairs from two adjacent Antarctic fur seal breeding colonies that differ in social density to investigate differences between skin and gut microbial communities in relation to host-specific and environmental factors. Using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we uncovered a strong influence of colony on the diversity and composition of skin but not gut microbial communities. Specifically, we observed a suppressive effect of high social density on skin microbial alpha diversity as well as an overabundance of phyla associated with diseases and bite wounds in the high-density colony. Our findings suggest that skin microbial communities may be more sensitive to external factors, whereas gut communities are more tightly regulated by the host. Overall, this study highlights the importance of considering multiple body sites and their distinct microbial communities to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the factors shaping microbial diversity and composition in marine mammals.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, Comparative analysis",Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
293,2024,High‐quality genome of a novel Thermosynechococcaceae species from Namibia and characterization of its protein expression patterns at elevated temperatures,"Thermophilic cyanobacteria thrive in extreme environments, making their thermoresistant enzymes valuable for industrial applications. Common habitats include hot springs, which act as evolutionary accelerators for speciation due to geographical isolation. The family Thermosynechococcaceae comprises thermophilic cyanobacteria known for their ability to thrive in high‐temperature environments. These bacteria are notable for their photosynthetic capabilities, significantly contributing to primary production in extreme habitats. Members of Thermosynechococcaceae exhibit unique adaptations that allow them to perform photosynthesis efficiently at elevated temperatures, making them subjects of interest for studies on microbial ecology, evolution, and potential biotechnological applications. In this study, the genome of a thermophilic cyanobacterium, isolated from a hot spring near Okahandja in Namibia, was sequenced using a PacBio Sequel IIe long‐read platform. Cultivations were performed at elevated temperatures of 40, 50, and 55°C, followed by proteome analyses based on the annotated genome. Phylogenetic investigations, informed by the 16S rRNA gene and aligned nucleotide identity (ANI), suggest that the novel cyanobacterium is a member of the family Thermosynechococcaceae. Furthermore, the new species was assigned to a separate branch, potentially representing a novel genus. Whole‐genome alignments supported this finding, revealing few conserved regions and multiple genetic rearrangement events. Additionally, 129 proteins were identified as differentially expressed in a temperature‐dependent manner. The results of this study broaden our understanding of cyanobacterial adaptation to extreme environments, providing a novel high‐quality genome of Thermosynechococcaceae cyanobacterium sp.

294,2024,Genomic Analysis of Aeromonas salmonicida ssp. salmonicida Isolates Collected During Multiple Clinical Outbreaks Supports Association with a Single Epidemiological Unit,"Outbreaks of furunculosis cause significant losses in salmonid aquaculture worldwide. With a recent rise in antimicrobial resistance, regulatory measures to minimize the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry, including aquaculture, have increased scrutiny and availability of veterinary medical products to control this disease in production facilities. In such a regulatory environment, the utility of autogenous vaccines to assist with disease prevention and control as a veterinary-guided prophylactic measure is of high interest to the producers and veterinary services alike. However, evolving concepts of epidemiological units and epidemiological links need to be considered during approval and acceptance procedures for the application of autogenous vaccines in multiple aquaculture facilities. Here, we present the results of solid-state nanopore sequencing (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, ONT) performed on 54 isolates of Aeromonas salmonicida ssp. salmonicida sampled during clinical outbreaks of furunculosis in different aquaculture facilities from Bavaria, Germany, from 2017 to 2020. All of the performed analyses (phylogeny, single nucleotide polymorphism and 3D protein modeling for major immunogenic proteins) support a high probability that all studied isolates belong to the same epidemiological unit. Simultaneously, we describe a cost/effective method of whole genome analysis with the usage of ONT as a viable strategy to study outbreaks of other pathogens in the field of aquatic veterinary medicine for the purpose of developing the best autogenous vaccine candidates applicable to multiple aquaculture establishments.",Pathogen,"Isolate, AMR",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
295,2024,"Microbial colonisation rewires the composition and content of poplar root exudates, root and shoot metabolomes","Background Trees are associated with a broad range of microorganisms colonising the diverse tissues of their host. However, the early dynamics of the microbiota assembly microbiota from the root to shoot axis and how it is linked to root exudates and metabolite contents of tissues remain unclear. Here, we characterised how fungal and bacterial communities are altering root exudates as well as root and shoot metabolomes in parallel with their establishment in poplar cuttings (Populus tremula x tremuloides clone T89) over 30 days of growth. Sterile poplar cuttings were planted in natural or gamma irradiated soils. Bulk and rhizospheric soils, root and shoot tissues were collected from day 1 to day 30 to track the dynamic changes of fungal and bacterial communities in the different habitats by DNA metabarcoding. Root exudates and root and shoot metabolites were analysed in parallel by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results Our study reveals that microbial colonisation triggered rapid and substantial alterations in both the composition and quantity of root exudates, with over 70 metabolites exclusively identified in remarkably high abundances in the absence of microorganisms. Noteworthy among these were lipid-related metabolites and defence compounds. The microbial colonisation of both roots and shoots exhibited a similar dynamic response, initially involving saprophytic microorganisms and later transitioning to endophytes and symbionts. Key constituents of the shoot microbiota were also discernible at earlier time points in the rhizosphere and roots, indicating that the soil constituted a primary source for shoot microbiota. Furthermore, the microbial colonisation of belowground and aerial compartments induced a reconfiguration of plant metabolism. Specifically, microbial colonisation predominantly instigated alterations in primary metabolism in roots, while in shoots, it primarily influenced defence metabolism. Conclusions This study highlighted the profound impact of microbial interactions on metabolic pathways of plants, shedding light on the intricate interplay between plants and their associated microbial communities.

296,2024,"Culture-Independent Characterization of Citrus Rhizospheric Bacterial and Fungal Microbiota from Piura, Peru","The “limón sutil” (Citrus aurantifolia) has been widely cultivated and well established for many years in Piura, northwestern Peru, because of its exceptional climate and soil conditions. However, decline and death of C. aurantifolia trees caused by different phytopathogens remain a common problem which has been observed in the last decades. It is known that the microbiota of soil plays an important role with their host and could be the starting point to understand the causes of citrus decline. In this study, we identified through culture-independent methods the bacterial and fungal microbiota associated to C. aurantifolia, C. jambhiri and C. volkameriana rhizospheres in the main areas of Piura. By using a 16S rRNA and ITS-metabarcoding analysis, we evaluated the taxonomic diversity between healthy trees and with decline symptoms and how this diversity could influence the health status of citrus trees. More than 600 and 200 bacterial and fungal ASVs were identified, respectively. Our metabarcoding analysis was able to identify Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidota and Acidobacteriota prokaryotic phyla, while fungal phyla included Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Glomeromycota. In addition, there were differences between microbial diversity indices in rhizospheres evaluated. Finally, bacterial and fungal genera were shared among the different citrus rhizospheres. These results have allowed us to obtain a preliminary identification of microbiota in the citrus rhizospheres of healthy trees and with decline symptoms.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
297,2024,Shifts in plant functional trait dynamics in relation to soil microbiome in modern and wild barley,"Understanding domestication's impact on crop root traits and interactions with soil microbiomes is vital for improving crop resilience and agricultural sustainability. Using this knowledge to enhance root systems, reduce chemical inputs, and adapt crops to environmental stress will help to increase global food production, promote eco‐friendly farming, and mitigate the effects of climate change. Additionally, identifying microorganisms specific to plant species may help in biodiversity conservation. Advancing scientific understanding and educating future generations on the intricate relationships between plants, soil, and microorganisms is integral to developing innovative, sustainable agricultural practices and improved food security.
Domestication and intensive management practices have significantly shaped characteristics of modern crops. However, our understanding of domestication's impact had mainly focused on aboveground plant traits, neglecting root and rhizospheric traits, as well as trait–trait interactions and root‐microbial interactions.
To address this knowledge gap, we grew modern (Hordeum vulgare L. var. Barke) and wild barley (Hordeum spontaneum K. Koch var. spontaneum) in large rhizoboxes. We manipulated the soil microbiome by comparing disturbed (sterilized soil inoculum, DSM) versus non‐disturbed (non‐sterilized inoculum, NSM) microbiome. Results showed that modern barley grew faster and increased organic‐carbon exudation (OCEXU) compared to wild barley.
Both barley species exhibited accelerated root growth and enhanced OCEXU under DSM, indicating their ability to partially compensate and exploit the soil resources independently of microbes if need be. Plant trait network analysis revealed that modern barley had a denser, larger, and less modular network of microbes than wild barley indicating domestication's impact on trait–trait coordination. In addition, the relative abundance of bacteria did not vary between wild and modern barley rhizospheres; however, species‐specific unique bacteria were identified, with stronger effects under DSM.
Overall, our findings highlight domestication‐driven shifts in root traits, trait coordination, and their modulation by the soil microbiome.

298,2024,Computational pipeline for targeted integration and variable payload expression for bacteriophage engineering,"Bacteriophages offer a promising alternative to conventional antimicrobial treatments, particularly in cases where such treatments have proven ineffective. While naturally occurring phages serve as viable options for phage therapy, advances in synthetic biology and genome engineering enable precise modifications to phages to enhance their therapeutic potential. One such approach is the introduction of antimicrobial genetic payloads into the phage genome. Conventional practice is to integrate such payloads behind genes expressed at very high levels late in the infection cycle, such as the major capsid gene (cps). Nevertheless, phages engineered to contain antimicrobial payloads are often difficult to obtain. For instance, the high expression of toxic payloads can prematurely halt host metabolism, leading to the failure in assembling viable phage progeny. To potentially expand the range of genes viable as genetic payloads, we developed a method to identify intergenic loci with favorable expression levels. We used the machine learning (ML)-based promoter prediction algorithm PhagePromoter to identify these loci. We then used this information to design a computationally-assisted engineering pipeline for the integration of genomic payloads at these locations. We validated our approach experimentally, engineering phages with bioluminescent reporter payloads at various predicted loci. We used the well characterized, strictly lytic, Staphylococcus aureus -infecting bacteriophage, K, as an engineering scaffold and employed homologous recombination to engineer three recombinant phages containing the reporter payload at different predicted loci throughout the genome. The recombinant phages exhibited expression levels consistent with our computational predictions and showed temporal expression patterns corresponding to their genomic locations in early, middle, or late gene clusters. Our study underscores the potential of integrating computational tools with classical sequence analysis to streamline the phage engineering process. This approach not only facilitates the rational design of phages with targeted payload insertions but also paves the way for high-throughput, automated phage engineering, fostering a new era of personalized phage therapy.","Bacteria, Virus",AMR,(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease

300,2024,The rhizosphere microbiome of 51 potato cultivars with diverse plant growth characteristics,"Abstract Rhizosphere microbial communities play a substantial role in plant productivity. We studied the rhizosphere bacteria and fungi of 51 distinct potato cultivars grown under similar greenhouse conditions using a metabarcoding approach. As expected, individual cultivars were the most important determining factor of the rhizosphere microbial composition; however, differences were also obtained when grouping cultivars according to their growth characteristics. We showed that plant growth characteristics were related to deterministic and stochastic assembly processes of bacterial and fungal communities, respectively. The bacterial genera Arthrobacter and Massilia (known to produce indole acetic acid and siderophores) exhibited greater relative abundance in high- and medium-performing cultivars. Bacterial co-occurrence networks were larger in the rhizosphere of these cultivars and were characterized by a distinctive combination of plant beneficial Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria along with a module of diazotrophs namely Azospira, Azoarcus, and Azohydromonas. Conversely, the network within low-performing cultivars revealed the lowest nodes, hub taxa, edges density, robustness, and the highest average path length resulting in reduced microbial associations, which may potentially limit their effectiveness in promoting plant growth. Our findings established a clear pattern between plant productivity and the rhizosphere microbiome composition and structure for the investigated potato cultivars, offering insights for future management practices.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, MAGs",Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

This study represents a pioneering investigation into these structures, assessing their formation, associated taxa, and ecological significance. Through a multifaceted approach that includes chemical analysis of the water body, multiscale characterization of the domes, and analysis of the associated microorganisms, we reveal the complex interplay between geology and biology in this extreme environment. The lake's alkaline waters that are rich in dissolved cations and anions such as chloride, sodium sulfate, and potassium, coupled with its location at the margin of the Antofalla salt flat, fed by alluvial fans and hydrothermal input, provide favorable conditions for mineral precipitation and support for the microorganism's activity. Laguna Verde's dome‐shaped structures are mainly composed of gypsum and halite, displaying an internal heterogeneous mesostructure consisting of three zones: microcrystalline, organic (orange and green layers), and crystalline. The green layer of the organic zone is predominantly composed of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Cyanobacteria, while the orange layer is mostly inhabited by Cyanobacteria. The results of the study suggest that oxygenic photosynthesis performed by Cyanobacteria is the main carbon fixation pathway in the microbial community, supported by carbon isotopic ratios of specific biomarkers.

303,2024,Comparative Metagenomic Analysis of Bacteriophages and Prophages in Gnotobiotic Mouse Models,"Gnotobiotic murine models are important to understand microbiota–host interactions. Despite the role of bacteriophages as drivers for microbiome structure and function, there is no information about the structure and function of the gut virome in gnotobiotic models and the link between bacterial and bacteriophage/prophage diversity. We studied the virome of gnotobiotic murine Oligo-MM12 (12 bacterial species) and reduced Altered Schaedler Flora (ASF, three bacterial species). As reference, the virome of Specific Pathogen-Free (SPF) mice was investigated. A metagenomic approach was used to assess prophages and bacteriophages in the guts of 6-week-old female mice. We identified a positive correlation between bacteria diversity, and bacteriophages and prophages. Caudoviricetes (82.4%) were the most prominent class of phages in all samples with differing relative abundance. However, the host specificity of bacteriophages belonging to class Caudoviricetes differed depending on model bacterial diversity. We further studied the role of bacteriophages in horizontal gene transfer and microbial adaptation to the host’s environment. Analysis of mobile genetic elements showed the contribution of bacteriophages to the adaptation of bacterial amino acid metabolism. Overall, our results implicate virome “dark matter” and interactions with the host system as factors for microbial community structure and function which determine host health. Taking the importance of the virome in the microbiome diversity and horizontal gene transfer, reductions in the virome might be an important factor driving losses of microbial biodiversity and the subsequent dysbiosis of the gut microbiome.","Bacteria, Virus, Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome, Comparative analysis","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
304,2023,Cultivar-specific dynamics: unravelling rhizosphere microbiome responses to water deficit stress in potato cultivars,"Background Growing evidence suggests that soil microbes can improve plant fitness under drought. However, in potato, the world’s most important non-cereal crop, the role of the rhizosphere microbiome under drought has been poorly studied. Using a cultivation independent metabarcoding approach, we examined the rhizosphere microbiome of two potato cultivars with different drought tolerance as a function of water regime (continuous versus reduced watering) and manipulation of soil microbial diversity (i.e., natural (NSM), vs. disturbed (DSM) soil microbiome). Results Water regime and soil pre-treatment showed a significant interaction with bacterial community composition of the sensitive (HERBST) but not the resistant cultivar (MONI). Overall, MONI had a moderate response to the treatments and its rhizosphere selected Rhizobiales under reduced watering in NSM soil, whereas Bradyrhizobium , Ammoniphilus , Symbiobacterium and unclassified Hydrogenedensaceae in DSM soil. In contrast, HERBST response to the treatments was more pronounced. Notably, in NSM soil treated with reduced watering, the root endophytic fungus Falciphora and many Actinobacteriota members ( Streptomyces , Glycomyces , Marmoricola , Aeromicrobium , Mycobacterium and others) were largely represented. However, DSM soil treatment resulted in no fungal taxa and fewer enrichment of these Actinobacteriota under reduced watering. Moreover, the number of bacterial core amplicon sequence variants (core ASVs) was more consistent in MONI regardless of soil pre-treatment and water regimes as opposed to HERBST, in which a marked reduction of core ASVs was observed in DSM soil. Conclusions Besides the influence of soil conditions, our results indicate a strong cultivar-dependent relationship between the rhizosphere microbiome of potato cultivars and their capacity to respond to perturbations such as reduced soil moisture. Our study highlights the importance of integrating soil conditions and plant genetic variability as key factors in future breeding programs aiming to develop drought resistance in a major food crop like potato. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms how plants recruit microbes from soil which help to mitigate plant stress and to identify key microbial taxa, which harbour the respective traits might therefore be an important topic for future research.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome, AMR, Variant",Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
305,2023,The ClpX protease is essential for inactivating the CI master repressor and completing prophage induction in Staphylococcus aureus,"Bacteriophages (phages) are the most abundant biological entities on Earth, exerting a significant influence on the dissemination of bacterial virulence, pathogenicity, and antimicrobial resistance. Temperate phages integrate into the bacterial chromosome in a dormant state through intricate regulatory mechanisms. These mechanisms repress lytic genes while facilitating the expression of integrase and the CI master repressor. Upon bacterial SOS response activation, the CI repressor undergoes auto-cleavage, producing two fragments with the N-terminal domain (NTD) retaining significant DNA-binding ability. The process of relieving CI NTD repression, essential for prophage induction, remains unknown. Here we show a specific interaction between the ClpX protease and CI NTD repressor fragment of phages Ф11 and 80α in Staphylococcus aureus. This interaction is necessary and sufficient for prophage activation after SOS-mediated CI auto-cleavage, defining the final stage in the prophage induction cascade. Our findings unveil unexpected roles of bacterial protease ClpX in phage biology.","Bacteria, Virus, Pathogen","Interactome, AMR",,Health & Disease
306,2023,Seasonal shifts in community composition and proteome expression in a sulphur-cycling cyanobacterial mat.,"Seasonal changes in light and physicochemical conditions have strong impacts on cyanobacteria, but how they affect community structure, metabolism, and biogeochemistry of cyanobacterial mats remains unclear. Light may be particularly influential for cyanobacterial mats exposed to sulphide by altering the balance of oxygenic photosynthesis and sulphide-driven anoxygenic photosynthesis. We studied temporal shifts in irradiance, water chemistry, and community structure and function of microbial mats in the Middle Island Sinkhole (MIS), where anoxic and sulphate-rich groundwater provides habitat for cyanobacteria that conduct both oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis. Seasonal changes in light and groundwater chemistry were accompanied by shifts in bacterial community composition, with a succession of dominant cyanobacteria from Phormidium to Planktothrix, and an increase in diatoms, sulphur-oxidizing bacteria, and sulphate-reducing bacteria from summer to autumn. Differential abundance of cyanobacterial light-harvesting proteins likely reflects a physiological response of cyanobacteria to light level. Beggiatoa sulphur oxidation proteins were more abundant in autumn. Correlated abundances of taxa through time suggest interactions between sulphur oxidizers and sulphate reducers, sulphate reducers and heterotrophs, and cyanobacteria and heterotrophs. These results support the conclusion that seasonal change, including light availability, has a strong influence on community composition and biogeochemical cycling of sulphur and O2 in cyanobacterial mats.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome",(Meta)proteomics,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

308,2023,Saltwater Intrusion Impacts Microbial Diversity and Function in Groundwater Ecosystems,"
 
 Groundwater ecosystem services provided by microbial communities are essential for the maintenance of water quality. For example, nitrate contamination is a recognised health and ecosystem issue in most groundwater systems, often alleviated through microbial processes. The effects of climate change, including increasing salinity from rising sea levels, or over-abstraction, on these communities are largely unknown.
 
 
 
 This study uses a combination of culture-dependent (growth curves, isolation of bacteria) and culture-independent (16S rRNA gene sequencing) methods to identify the potential effects of saltwater intrusion on groundwater microbes and their ecosystem functions.
 
 
 
 Some groundwater microbial communities are negatively impacted by increasing chloride concentrations, including declines in bacteria responsible for nitrate and ammonia removal. These ecosystems should be prioritised for future protection from sea level rise or increased extraction of groundwater for agriculture and other uses. Other microbial communities are stimulated in the presence of chloride, often caused by an increase in abundance of salt-tolerant heterotrophic bacteria using sugars, peptides, or organic acids for energy.
 
 
 
 There have been no previous studies investigating the impact of chloride on Aotearoa New Zealand groundwaters. The identification of keystone species that are affected by increasing salinity, which have a disproportionately large effect on the ecosystem and low functional redundancy, is essential. Water management decisions about future abstraction limits and defences against sea level rise can be underpinned by robust scientific knowledge about microbial community sensitivity to salinity.

309,2023,Assessment of Antifungal/Anti-Oomycete Activity of Frass Derived from Black Soldier Fly Larvae to Control Plant Pathogens in Horticulture: Involvement of Bacillus velezensis,"Frass, the residual material resulting from the bioconversion of organic matter by black soldier fly larvae (BSFL), has gained attention as a sustainable alternative to conventional fertilizers due to its high nutrient content. Additionally, frass has been found to possess antifungal properties, which can help control plant pathogens affecting horticultural crops. In this study, frass from BSFL reared on the Gainesville diet, a universally employed reference/control diet, was investigated in vitro for its effect on the growth of seven important fungal/oomycete pathogens. Dual culture overlay assays clearly showed that fresh Gainesville diet extract, as well as BSFL frass extract derived from this diet, contained microorganisms producing compound(s) that strongly inhibit(s) the mycelial growth of fungal/oomycete plant pathogens. Fungi and bacteria were then isolated from the fresh Gainesville diet and BSFL frass using the serial dilution technique. Among the different fungi/bacteria isolated, the isolate GV1-11 in Gainesville diet and FGV15-6 in frass demonstrated strong antifungal/anti-oomycete activity. Both isolates were genetically identified by whole-genome sequencing as Bacillus velezensis, a bacterium used as a biocontrol agent, strongly suggesting that B. velezensis, which is present in the Gainesville diet, can survive the process of BSFL rearing and is one of the key factors contributing to the observed antifungal and anti-oomycete activity in the resulting frass. This work underlines the importance of the inherent microbial characteristics of feedstocks on the antifungal/anti-oomycete activity of frass and points out the possibility of exploiting frass to control plant pathogens affecting horticultural crops.","Bacteria, Pathogen",Isolate,(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
310,2023,Interspecies and spatial differences in the shell microbiome of Atlantic rock crab Cancer irrotatus and European green crab Carcinus maenas from Atlantic Canada,"The native Atlantic rock crab (Cancer irrotatus) and the invasive European green crab (Carcinus maenas) are commercially and ecologically important crustacean species in Atlantic Canada. The importance of microbiomes for host health and ecology has been recognized in many species, although very few studies have focused on crustaceans or their external shell microbiome. This is the first-ever study to characterize and analyze the microbial communities associated with the external carapace of C. irrotatus and C. maenas.Microbiome samples were collected from three locations in Atlantic Canada, processed using standard 16S Illumina MiSeq PE250 sequencing and analyzed with the open-access QIIME2 software.Taxonomic classification of the microbial compositions, as well as alpha- and beta diversities, reveal that the shell microbiome differs by host species between C. irrotatus and C. maenas sampled from the same location and between C. irrotatus sampled from different locations. Interestingly, the differences are greater between species at the same location than between locations for the same species.These are the first-ever results showing that the crustacean shell microbiome not only depends on geographical factors but also on intrinsic factors specific to the host species. This implies that crustaceans exert some impact on their shell microbiome, potentially selecting beneficial taxa. These are important findings that could elucidate contributing factors of crustacean shell diseases that are still poorly understood.",Microbiome,Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
311,2023,Assessing antimicrobial and metal resistance genes in Escherichia coli from domestic groundwater supplies in rural Ireland.,"Natural ecosystems can become significant reservoirs and/or pathways for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) dissemination, with the potential to affect nearby microbiological, animal, and ultimately human communities. This is further accentuated in environments that provide direct human exposure, such as drinking water. To date, however, few studies have investigated AMR dissemination potential and the presence of co-selective stressors (e.g., metals/metalloids) in groundwater environments of human health significance. Accordingly, the present study analysed samples from rural (drinking) groundwater supplies (i.e., private wells) in the Republic of Ireland, where land use is dominated by livestock grazing activities. In total, 48 Escherichia coli isolates tested phenotypically for antimicrobial susceptibility in an earlier study were further subject to whole genome sequencing (WGS) and corresponding water samples were further analysed for trace metal/metalloid concentrations. Eight isolates (i.e., 16.7%) were genotypically resistant to antimicrobials, confirming prior phenotypic results through the identification of ten antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs); namely: aph(3″)-lb (strA; n=7), aph(6)-Id (strA; n = 6), blaTEM (n = 6), sul2 (n = 6), tetA (n = 4), floR (n = 2), dfrA5 (n = 1), tetB (n = 1), and tetY (n = 1). Additional bioinformatic analysis revealed that all ARGs were plasmid-borne, except for two of the six sul2 genes, and that 31.2% of all tested isolates (n = 15) and 37.5% of resistant ones (n = 3) carried virulence genes. Study results also found no significant relationships between metal concentrations and ARG abundance. Additionally, just one genetic linkage was identified between ARGs and a metal resistance gene (MRG), namely merA, a mercury-resistant gene found on the same plasmid as blaTEM, dfrA5, strA, strB, and sul2 in the only isolate of inferred porcine (as opposed to bovine) origin. Overall, findings suggest that ARG (and MRG) acquisition may be occurring prior to groundwater ingress, and are likely a legacy issue arising from agricultural practices.",Microbiome,"Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
312,2023,Feature selection of the respiratory microbiota associated with asthma,"The expanding development of data mining and statistical learning techniques have enriched recent efforts to understand and identify metagenomics biomarkers in airways diseases. In contribution to the growing microbiota research in respiratory contexts, this study aims to characterize respiratory microbiota in asthmatic patients (pediatrics and adults) in comparison to healthy controls, to explore the potential of microbiota as a biomarker for asthma diagonosis and prediction. Analysis of 16 S-ribosomal RNA gene sequences reveals that respiratory microbial composition and diversity are significantly different between asthmatic and healthy subjects. Phylum Proteobacteria represented the predominant bacterial communities in asthmatic patients in comparison to healthy subjects. In contrast, a higher abundance of Moraxella and Alloiococcus was more prevalent in asthmatic patients compared to healthy controls. Using a machine learning approach, 57 microbial markers were identified and used to characterize notable microbiota composition differences between the groups. Among the selected OTUs, Moraxella and Corynebacterium genera were found to be more enriched on the pediatric asthmatics (p-values < 0.01). In the era of precision medicine, the discovery of the respiratory microbiota associated with asthma can lead to valuable applications for individualized asthma care.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Gene identification / Biomarker","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
313,2023,"Association of Virulence, Biofilm, and Antimicrobial Resistance Genes with Specific Clonal Complex Types of Listeria monocytogenes","Precise classification of foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is a necessity in efficient foodborne disease surveillance, outbreak detection, and source tracking throughout the food chain. In this study, a total of 150 L. monocytogenes isolates from various food products, food processing environments, and clinical sources were investigated for variations in virulence, biofilm formation, and the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes based on their Whole-Genome Sequences. Clonal complex (CC) determination based on Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) revealed twenty-eight CC-types including eight isolates representing novel CC-types. The eight isolates comprising the novel CC-types share the majority of the known (cold and acid) stress tolerance genes and are all genetic lineage II, serogroup 1/2a-3a. Pan-genome-wide association analysis by Scoary using Fisher’s exact test identified eleven genes specifically associated with clinical isolates. Screening for the presence of antimicrobial and virulence genes using the ABRicate tool uncovered variations in the presence of Listeria Pathogenicity Islands (LIPIs) and other known virulence genes. Specifically, the distributions of actA, ecbA, inlF, inlJ, lapB, LIPI-3, and vip genes across isolates were found to be significantly CC-dependent while the presence of ami, inlF, inlJ, and LIPI-3 was associated with clinical isolates specifically. In addition, Roary-derived phylogenetic grouping based on Antimicrobial-Resistant Genes (AMRs) revealed that the thiol transferase (FosX) gene was present in all lineage I isolates, and the presence of the lincomycin resistance ABC-F-type ribosomal protection protein (lmo0919_fam) was also genetic-lineage-dependent. More importantly, the genes found to be specific to CC-type were consistent when a validation analysis was performed with fully assembled, high-quality complete L. monocytogenes genome sequences (n = 247) extracted from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) microbial genomes database. This work highlights the usefulness of MLST-based CC typing using the Whole-Genome Sequence as a tool in classifying isolates.",Pathogen,"Isolate, AMR, (M)LST",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

315,2023,Genomic Characterization of Arcobacter butzleri Strains Isolated from Various Sources in Lithuania,"Arcobacter (A.) butzleri, the most widespread species within the genus Arcobacter, is considered as an emerging pathogen causing gastroenteritis in humans. Here, we performed a comparative genome-wide analysis of 40 A. butzleri strains from Lithuania to determine the genetic relationship, pangenome structure, putative virulence, and potential antimicrobial- and heavy-metal-resistance genes. Core genome single nucleotide polymorphism (cgSNP) analysis revealed low within-group variability (≤4 SNPs) between three milk strains (RCM42, RCM65, RCM80) and one human strain (H19). Regardless of the type of input (i.e., cgSNPs, accessory genome, virulome, resistome), these strains showed a recurrent phylogenetic and hierarchical grouping pattern. A. butzleri demonstrated a relatively large and highly variable accessory genome (comprising of 6284 genes with around 50% of them identified as singletons) that only partially correlated to the isolation source. Downstream analysis of the genomes resulted in the detection of 115 putative antimicrobial- and heavy-metal-resistance genes and 136 potential virulence factors that are associated with the induction of infection in host (e.g., cadF, degP, iamA), survival and environmental adaptation (e.g., flagellar genes, CheA-CheY chemotaxis system, urease cluster). This study provides additional knowledge for a better A. butzleri-related risk assessment and highlights the need for further genomic epidemiology studies in Lithuania and other countries.",Pathogen,"Isolate, AMR, SNP, Comparative analysis",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
316,2023,The initial composition and structure of microbial community determined the yield and quality of Baijiu during the spontaneous fermentation.,"The microbiota during pit mud fermentation is a crucial factor in Baijiu brewing since it determines the yield and flavor. However, the impact of the microbial community during the initial fermentation stage on Baijiu quality remains uncertain. Herein, high-throughput sequencing was employed to investigate the microbial diversities and distribution during Baijiu fermentation in individual pit mud workshops at both initial and late stages. During the initial fermentation stage, the bacterial community exerted a more pronounced effect on Baijiu quality than the fungal community. And the high-yield pit mud workshop exhibited lower richness and evenness, as well as greater Bray-Curtis dissimilarity during Baijiu fermentation. Lactobacillus was the dominant genus and biomarker in high-yield pit mud, and it constituted the only genus within the bacterial association network during the late fermentation stage. Fungal communities tended to maintain a simple association network with selected core species. Based on the correlation network, Rhizopus and Trichosporon were identified as biomarkers in Baijiu fermentation process. Together, Lactobacillus and Rhizopus could serve as bio-indicators for Baijiu quality during the initial fermentation stage. Therefore, these findings provided novel insights into microbiota interactions during fermentation and the impact of initial microbiota on final Baijiu quality.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Interactome, Gene identification / Biomarker",,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
317,2023,"Selective Bacteriocins: A Promising Treatment for Staphylococcus aureus Skin Infections Reveals Insights into Resistant Mutants, Vancomycin Resistance, and Cell Wall Alterations","The emergence of antibiotic-resistant S. aureus has become a major public health concern, necessitating the discovery of new antimicrobial compounds. Given that the skin microbiome plays a critical role in the host defence against pathogens, the development of therapies that target the interactions between commensal bacteria and pathogens in the skin microbiome offers a promising approach. Here, we report the discovery of two bacteriocins, cerein 7B and cerein B4080, that selectively inhibit S. aureus without affecting S. epidermidis, a commensal bacterium on the skin. Our study revealed that exposure of S. aureus to these bacteriocins resulted in mutations in the walK/R two-component system, leading to a thickening of the cell wall visible by transmission electron microscopy and subsequent decreased sensitivity to vancomycin. Our findings prompt a nuanced discussion of the potential of those bacteriocins for selective targeting of S. aureus on the skin, given the emergence of resistance and co-resistance with vancomycin. The idea put forward implies that by preserving commensal bacteria, selective compounds could limit the emergence of resistance in pathogenic cells by promoting competition with remaining commensal bacteria, ultimately reducing chronical infections and limiting the spread of antibiotic resistance.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Interactome, AMR",,Health & Disease
318,2023,"Genomic Determinants of Pathogenicity and Antimicrobial Resistance of Nosocomial Acinetobacter baumannii Clinical Isolates of Hospitalized Patients (2019–2021) from a Sentinel Hospital in Hangzhou, China","Purpose Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii or AB) is one of the most opportunistic, nosocomial pathogens threatening public healthcare across countries. A. baumannii has become a primary growing concern due to its exceptional ability to acquire antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to multiple antimicrobial agents which is increasingly reported and more prevalent every year. Therefore, there is an urgent need to evaluate the AMR knowledge of A. baumannii for effective clinical treatment of nosocomial infections. This study aimed to investigate the clinical distribution AMR phenotypes and genotypes, and genomic characteristics of A. baumannii isolates recovered from hospitalized patients of different clinical departments of a sentinel hospital to improve clinical practices. Methods A total of 123 clinical isolates were recovered from hospitalized patients of different clinical departments during 2019–2021 to analyze AMR patterns, and further subjected to whole-genome sequencing (WGS) investigations. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), as well as the presence of antimicrobial-resistant genes (ARGs), virulence factor genes (VFGs) and insertion sequences (ISs) were also investigated from WGS data. Results The results highlighted that A. baumannii clinical isolates had shown a high AMR rate, particularly from the intensive care unit (ICU), towards routinely used antimicrobials, ie, β-lactams and fluoroquinolones. ST2 was the most prevalent ST in the clinical isolates, it was strongly associated to the resistance of cephalosporins and carbapenems, with blaOXA-23 and blaOXA-66 being the most frequent determinants; moreover, high carrier rate of VFGs was also observed such as all strains containing the ompA, adeF, pgaC, lpsB, and bfmR genes. Conclusion Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates are mostly ST2 with high rates of drug resistance and carrier of virulence factors.

ABSTRACT Campylobacter ureolyticus is an emerging pathogen increasingly appreciated as a common cause of gastroenteritis and extra-intestinal infections in humans. Outside the setting of gastroenteritis, little work has been done to describe the genomic content and relatedness of the species, especially regarding clinical isolates. We reviewed the epidemiology of clinical C. ureolyticus cultured by our institution over the past 10 years. Fifty-one unique C. ureolyticus isolates were identified between January 2010 and August 2022, mostly originating from abscesses and blood cultures. To clarify the taxonomic relationships between isolates and to attribute specific genes with different clinical manifestations, we sequenced 19 available isolates from a variety of clinical specimen types and conducted a pangenomic analysis with publicly available C. ureolyticus genomes. Digital DNA:DNA hybridization suggested that these C. ureolyticus comprised a species complex of 10 species clusters (SCs) and several subspecies clusters. Although some orthologous genes or gene functions were enriched in isolates found in different SCs and clinical specimens, no association was significant. Nearly a third of the isolates possessed antimicrobial resistance genes, including the ermA resistance gene, potentially conferring resistance to macrolides, the treatment of choice for severe human campylobacteriosis. This work effectively doubles the number of publicly available C. ureolyticus genomes, provides further clarification of taxonomic relationships within this bacterial complex, and identifies target SCs for future analysis.","Bacteria, Pathogen","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, AMR, Comparative analysis",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease
320,2023,Mimicked Mixing-Induced Heterogeneities of Industrial Bioreactors Stimulate Long-Lasting Adaption Programs in Ethanol-Producing Yeasts,"Commercial-scale bioreactors create an unnatural environment for microbes from an evolutionary point of view. Mixing insufficiencies expose individual cells to fluctuating nutrient concentrations on a second-to-minute scale while transcriptional and translational capacities limit the microbial adaptation time from minutes to hours. This mismatch carries the risk of inadequate adaptation effects, especially considering that nutrients are available at optimal concentrations on average. Consequently, industrial bioprocesses that strive to maintain microbes in a phenotypic sweet spot, during lab-scale development, might suffer performance losses when said adaptive misconfigurations arise during scale-up. Here, we investigated the influence of fluctuating glucose availability on the gene-expression profile in the industrial yeast Ethanol Red™. The stimulus–response experiment introduced 2 min glucose depletion phases to cells growing under glucose limitation in a chemostat. Even though Ethanol Red™ displayed robust growth and productivity, a single 2 min depletion of glucose transiently triggered the environmental stress response. Furthermore, a new growth phenotype with an increased ribosome portfolio emerged after complete adaptation to recurring glucose shortages. The results of this study serve a twofold purpose. First, it highlights the necessity to consider the large-scale environment already at the experimental development stage, even when process-related stressors are moderate. Second, it allowed the deduction of strain engineering guidelines to optimize the genetic background of large-scale production hosts.",,,,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

Alongside, the quantitative and qualitative yield and the reproducibility of different protocols has been assessed. Methods Both eyes of 7 eligible volunteers were sampled. Five commercially available DNA extraction protocols were selected based on previous publications in the field of the ocular surface microbiome and 2 host DNA depletion protocols were added based on their reported effective host DNA depletion without significant reduction in bacterial DNA concentration. The V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was targeted using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The DADA2 pipeline in R was used to perform the bio-informatic processing and taxonomical assignment was done using the SILVA v132 database. The Vegdist function was used to calculate Bray-Curtis distances and the Galaxy web application was used to identify potential metagenomic biomarkers via linear discriminant analysis Effect Size (LEfSe). The R package Decontam was applied to control for potential contaminants. Results Samples analysed with PowerSoil, RNeasy and NucleoSpin had the highest DNA yield. The host DNA depletion kits showed a very low microbial DNA yield; and these samples were pooled per kit before sequencing. Despite pooling, 1 of both failed to construct a library. Looking at the beta-diversity, clear microbial compositional differences - dependent on the extraction protocol used – were observed and remained present after decontamination. Eighteen genera were consistently retrieved from the ocular surface of every volunteer by all non-pooled extraction kits and a comprehensive list of differentially abundant bacteria per extraction method was generated using LefSe analysis. Conclusion High-quality papers have been published in the field of the ocular surface microbiome but consensus on the importance of the extraction protocol used are lacking. Potential contaminants and discriminative genera per extraction protocol used, were introduced and a reference frame was built to facilitate both the interpretation of currently published papers and to ease future choice – making based on the research question at hand.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Gene identification / Biomarker","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

Conventional control methods have limitations in terms of effectiveness or economic aspects and cause public health concerns. Thus, biological control methods have come into the field, and microorganisms play a key role in suppressing tobacco black shank disease. Methods In this study, we examined the impact of soil microbial community on black shank disease basing on the structural difference of bacterial communities in rhizosphere soils. We used Illumina sequencing to compare the bacterial community diversity and structure in different rhizosphere soil samples in terms of healthy tobacco, tobacco showing typical black shank symptoms, and tobacco treated with the biocontrol agent, Bacillus velezensis S719. Results We found that Alphaproteobacteria in the biocontrol group, accounted for 27.2% of the ASVs, was the most abundant bacterial class among three groups. Heatmap and LEfSe analyses were done to determine the distinct bacterial genera in the three sample groups. For the healthy group, Pseudomonas was the most significant genus; for the diseased group, Stenotrophomonas exhibited the strongest enrichment trend, and Sphingomonas showed the highest linear discriminant analysis score, and was even more abundant than Bacillus; for the biocontrol group, Bacillus, and Gemmatimonas were the largely distributed genus. In addition, co-occurrence network analysis confirmed the abundance of taxa, and detected a recovery trend in the network topological parameters of the biocontrol group. Further functional prediction also provided a possible explanation for the bacterial community changes with related KEGG annotation terms. Discussion These findings will improve our knowledge of plant-microbe interactions and the application of biocontrol agents to improve plant fitness, and may contribute to the selection of biocontrol strains.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome, Annotation",,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

Four distinct serotypes were identified; Salmonella Minnesota (16/39, 41%), Salmonella Infantis (13/39, 33.3%), Salmonella Enteritidis (9/39, 23.1%), and one isolate was detected for Salmonella Kentucky (1/39, 2.6%), with sequence types (STs) as followed: ST548, ST32, ST11, and ST198, respectively. Phenotypic resistance to tetracycline (91.2%), ampicillin (82.4%), sulfisoxazole (64.7%), and nalidixic acid (61.6%) was the most observed. Resistome analysis revealed the presence of resistance genes to aminoglycosides, β-lactamase, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, phenicol, lincosamide, macrolides, and tetracyclines. Plasmidome showed the presence of eight incompatibility groups, including IncA/C2, IncFIB(K)_1_Kpn3, Col440I_1, IncR, IncX1, IncI1_1_Alpha, IncFIB(S)/IncFII(S), IncHI2/IncHI2A, IncX2 and ColpVC plasmids across the 39 genomes. Three resistance genes, sul2, tetA and blaCMY-2, were predicted to be located on IncA/C2 plasmid in S. Minnesota isolates, whereas all S. Infantis isolates were positive to IncFIB(K)_1_Kpn3 plasmid that carries blaCTX-M-65 gene. Eleven Salmonella pathogenicity islands and up to 131 stress and/or virulence genes were identified in the evaluated genomes. Phylogenetic analysis showed four phylogroups that were consistent with the identified ST profiles with a high level of inter-diversity between isolates. This is the first genomic characterization of Salmonella isolates from retail chicken meat in Saudi Arabia using WGS technology. The availability of Salmonella genomes from multiple geographic locations, including Saudi Arabia, would be highly beneficial in future source-tracking, especially during epidemiological surveillance and outbreak investigations.",Pathogen,"Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
327,2023,Enterococcal Linear Plasmids Adapt to Enterococcus faecium and Spread within Multidrug-Resistant Clades,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of bacterial pathogens, including enterococci, is a global concern, and plasmids are crucial for spreading and maintaining AMR genes. Plasmids with linear topology were identified recently in clinical multidrug-resistant enterococci. ABSTRACT Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of bacterial pathogens, including enterococci, is a global concern, and plasmids are crucial for spreading and maintaining AMR genes. Plasmids with linear topology were identified recently in clinical multidrug-resistant enterococci. The enterococcal linear-form plasmids, such as pELF1, confer resistance to clinically important antimicrobials, including vancomycin; however, little information exists about their epidemiological and physiological effects. In this study, we identified several lineages of enterococcal linear plasmids that are structurally conserved and occur globally. pELF1-like linear plasmids show plasticity in acquiring and maintaining AMR genes, often via transposition with the mobile genetic element IS1216E. This linear plasmid family has several characteristics enabling long-term persistence in the bacterial population, including high horizontal self-transmissibility, low-level transcription of plasmid-carried genes, and a moderate effect on the Enterococcus faecium genome alleviating fitness cost and promoting vertical inheritance. Combining all of these factors, the linear plasmid is an important factor in the spread and maintenance of AMR genes among enterococci.","Bacteria, Pathogen",AMR,(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease
328,2023,Evaluation of Physicochemical and Microbial Properties of Extracts from Wine Lees Waste of Matelica’s Verdicchio and Their Applications in Novel Cosmetic Products,"Wine lees are sediments deposited on the walls and bottom of barrels resulting from wine fermentation and mainly consist of yeasts. Saccharomyces cerevisiae extracts, rich in beneficial components for the skin, have already been used in cosmesis, while wine lees have not been well exploited by the cosmetics industry yet. The aim of this work was the full characterization of the wine lees from Verdicchio’s wine, with the aim to exploit it as a beneficial ingredient in new cosmetic products. After mapping the microbial composition of the sample waste, the parameters for the sonication extraction process were optimized and the physicochemical properties of the extract were analyzed. The efficiency of the aqueous extraction—and in particular the yeast cell lysis necessary for the release of proteins from the cell—was assessed by evaluating cell shape and size, and protein release, under scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and Bradford’s protein assays. Thus, the total phenol content and antioxidant capacity of the supernatant recovered from native and sonicated lees were determined by Folin–Ciocalteu’s and spectrophotometric assays, respectively. To quantify the heavy metals and highlight the presence of microelements beneficial for the skin, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was applied. In vitro metabolic activity and cytotoxicity were tested on both HaCat keratinocytes and human gingival fibroblasts, showing that wine lees are safe for skin’s cells. The results show that sonicated lees appear to be more interesting than native ones as a consequence of the release of the active ingredients from the cells. Due to the high antioxidant capacity, content of beneficial elements for skin and an appropriate microbiologic profile, wine lees were included in five new solid cosmetic products and tested for challenge test, compatibility with human skin, sensory analysis, trans epidermal water loss (TEWL) and sebometry.",,,(Meta)proteomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
329,2023,"Uropathogenic Escherichia coli population structure and antimicrobial susceptibility in Norfolk, UK","Background Half of all women have experienced a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime and this remains a persistent issue in rural counties like Norfolk, UK. In alignment globally, Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) are the main etiological agent for UTIs in Norfolk and are increasingly difficult to treat due to multi-drug resistance (MDR). Objective We set out to identify which clonal groups and resistance genes are disseminating in the community and hospitals in Norfolk, the first study of its kind for UPEC in this region. Methods We collected 217 clinical E. coli isolates causing UTIs in the community and hospital from the Clinical Microbiology laboratory at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital. These were whole genome sequenced using the Illumina and MinION platforms for in silico multi-locus sequence typing and antibiotic resistance determinant detection. Results The isolates were composed of 74 sequence types (STs); 8 lineages represented 57% of this population: ST73, ST12, ST69, ST131, ST404, ST95, ST127, and ST1193. Importantly, primary UTI screening deemed 8% of isolates to be MDR, with high rates of resistance to ampicillin (52.1%) and trimethoprim (36.2%) in hospitals. Of concern is the probable clonal expansion of MDR groups ST131 and ST1193 in hospitals and community settings with chromosomally encoded blaCTX-M-15, blaOXA-1, and aac(6’)-Ib-cr5. Conclusions The burden of reported UTIs in Norfolk is largely caused by non-MDR isolates. The UPEC population is continually evolving, and monitoring samples with consideration of sources will help reduce burden of disease.","Microbiome, Pathogen","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR, (M)LST",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease
330,2023,Transcriptional Control of hgcAB by an ArsR-Like Regulator in Pseudodesulfovibrio mercurii ND132,"This work reveals a link between microbial mercury methylation and arsenic resistance and may hold clues to the evolution of mercury methylation genes (hgcAB). Microbes with hgcAB produce methylmercury, a strong neurotoxin that readily accumulates in the food web. ABSTRACT The hgcAB gene pair encodes mercury (Hg) methylation capability in a diverse group of microorganisms, but its evolution and transcriptional regulation remain unknown. Working from the possibility that the evolutionary function of HgcAB may not be Hg methylation, we test a possible link to arsenic resistance. Using model Hg methylator Pseudodesulfovibrio mercurii ND132, we evaluated transcriptional control of hgcAB by a putative ArsR encoded upstream and cotranscribed with hgcAB. This regulator shares homology with ArsR repressors of arsenic resistance and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH)-responsive regulators of methionine biosynthesis but is distinct from other ArsR/SahR proteins in P. mercurii. Using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) transcriptome analyses, we confirmed this ArsR regulates hgcAB transcription and is responsive to arsenic and SAH. Additionally, RNA-seq indicated a possible link between hgcAB activity and arsenic transformations, with significant upregulation of other ArsR-regulated arsenic resistance operons alongside hgcAB. Interestingly, wild-type ND132 was less sensitive to As(V) (but not As(III)) than an hgcAB knockout strain, supporting the idea that hgcAB may be linked to arsenic resistance. Arsenic significantly impacted rates of Hg methylation by ND132; however, responses varied with culture conditions. Differences in growth and metabolic activity did not account for arsenic impacts on methylation. While arsenic significantly increased hgcAB expression, hgcAB gene and transcript abundance was not a good predictor of Hg methylation rates. Taken together, these results support the idea that Hg and As cycling are linked in P. mercurii ND132. Our results may hold clues to the evolution of hgcAB and the controls on Hg methylation in nature. IMPORTANCE This work reveals a link between microbial mercury methylation and arsenic resistance and may hold clues to the evolution of mercury methylation genes (hgcAB). Microbes with hgcAB produce methylmercury, a strong neurotoxin that readily accumulates in the food web. This study addresses a critical gap in our understanding about the environmental factors that control hgcAB expression. We show that hgcAB expression is controlled by an ArsR-like regulator responsive to both arsenic and S-adenosylhomocysteine in our model organism, Pseudodesulfovibrio mercurii ND132. Exposure to arsenic also significantly impacted Pseudodesulfovibrio mercurii ND132 mercury methylation rates. However, expression of hgcAB was not always a good predictor of Hg methylation rates, highlighting the roles of Hg bioavailability and other biochemical mechanisms in methylmercury production. This study improves our understanding of the controls on hgcAB expression, which is needed to better predict environmental methylmercury production.",,"Functional analysis, AMR",(Meta)transcriptomics,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
331,2023,Bubbleless Air Shapes Biofilms and Facilitates Natural Organic Matter Transformation in Biological Activated Carbon.,"The biodegradation in the middle and downstream of slow-rate biological activated carbon (BAC) is limited by insufficient dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. In this study, a bubbleless aerated BAC (termed ABAC) process was developed by installing a hollow fiber membrane (HFM) module within a BAC filter to continuously provide aeration throughout the BAC system. The BAC filter without an HFM was termed NBAC. The laboratory-scale ABAC and NBAC systems operated continuously for 426 days using secondary sewage effluent as an influent. The DO concentrations for NBAC and ABAC were 0.78 ± 0.27 and 4.31 ± 0.44 mg/L, respectively, with the latter providing the ABAC with greater electron acceptors for biodegradation and a microbial community with better biodegradation and metabolism capacity. The biofilms in ABAC secreted 47.3% less EPS and exhibited greater electron transfer capacity than those in NBAC, resulting in enhanced contaminant degradation efficiency and long-term stability. The extra organic matter removed by ABAC included refractory substances with a low elemental ratio of oxygen to carbon (O/C) and a high elemental ratio of hydrogen to carbon (H/C). The proposed ABAC filter provides a valuable, practical example of how to modify the BAC technology to shape the microbial community, and its activity, by optimizing the ambient atmosphere.",Microbiome,Community (taxonomy) profiling,,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
332,2023,Omics and imaging combinatorial approach reveals butyrate-induced inflammatory effects in the zebrafish gut,"Background Prebiotic feed additives aim to improve gut health by influencing the microbiota and the gut barrier. Most studies on feed additives concentrate on one or two (monodisciplinary) outcome parameters, such as immunity, growth, microbiota or intestinal architecture. A combinatorial and comprehensive approach to disclose the complex and multifaceted effects of feed additives is needed to understand their underlying mechanisms before making health benefit claims. Here, we used juvenile zebrafish as a model species to study effects of feed additives by integrating gut microbiota composition data and host gut transcriptomics with high-throughput quantitative histological analysis. Zebrafish received either control, sodium butyrate or saponin-supplemented feed. Butyrate-derived components such as butyric acid or sodium butyrate have been widely used in animal feeds due to their immunostimulant properties, thereby supporting intestinal health. Soy saponin is an antinutritional factor from soybean meal that promotes inflammation due to its amphipathic nature. Results We observed distinct microbial profiles associated with each diet, discovering that butyrate (and saponin to a lesser extent) affected gut microbial composition by reducing the degree of community-structure (co-occurrence network analysis) compared to controls. Analogously, butyrate and saponin supplementation impacted the transcription of numerous canonical pathways compared to control-fed fish. For example, both butyrate and saponin increased the expression of genes associated with immune response and inflammatory response, as well as oxidoreductase activity, compared to controls. Furthermore, butyrate decreased the expression of genes associated with histone modification, mitotic processes and G-coupled receptor activity. High-throughput quantitative histological analysis depicted an increase of eosinophils and rodlet cells in the gut tissue of fish receiving butyrate after one week of feeding and a depletion of mucus-producing cells after 3 weeks of feeding this diet. Combination of all datasets indicated that in juvenile zebrafish, butyrate supplementation increases the immune and the inflammatory response to a greater extent than the established inflammation-inducing anti-nutritional factor saponin. Such comprehensive analysis was supplemented by in vivo imaging of neutrophil and macrophage transgenic reporter zebrafish (mpeg1:mCherry/mpx:eGFPi^114) larvae. Upon exposure to butyrate and saponin, these larvae displayed a dose-dependent increase of neutrophils and macrophages in the gut area. Conclusion The omics and imaging combinatorial approach provided an integrated evaluation of the effect of butyrate on fish gut health and unraveled inflammatory-like features not previously reported that question the usage of butyrate supplementation to enhance fish gut health under basal conditions. The zebrafish model, due to its unique advantages, provides researchers with an invaluable tool to investigate effects of feed components on fish gut health throughout life.","Virus, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,"(Meta)transcriptomics, Imaging","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
333,2023,Maternal effects drive intestinal development beginning in the embryonic period on the basis of maternal immune and microbial transfer in chickens,"Background Nutrition drives immunity and health in animals, and maternal immunity benefits offspring. In our previous study, a nutritional intervention strategy was found to promote the immunity of hens, which subsequently improved immunity and growth in offspring chicks. Maternal effects clearly exist, but how are mothers’ immune advantages transferred to their offspring, and how do they benefit them? Results Here, we traced the beneficial effects back to the process of egg formation in the reproductive system, and we focused on the embryonic intestinal transcriptome and development, as well as on maternal microbial transfer in offspring. We found that maternal nutritional intervention benefits maternal immunity, egg hatching, and offspring growth. The results of protein and gene quantitative assays showed that the transfer of immune factors into egg whites and yolks depends on maternal levels. Histological observations indicated that the promotion of offspring intestinal development begins in the embryonic period. Microbiota analyses suggested that maternal microbes transfer to the embryonic gut from the magnum to the egg white. Transcriptome analyses revealed that offspring embryonic intestinal transcriptome shifts are related to development and immunity. Moreover, correlation analyses showed that the embryonic gut microbiota is correlated with the intestinal transcriptome and development. Conclusions This study suggests that maternal immunity positively influences offspring intestinal immunity establishment and intestinal development beginning in the embryonic period. Adaptive maternal effects might be accomplished via the transfer of relatively large amounts of maternal immune factors and by shaping of the reproductive system microbiota by strong maternal immunity. Moreover, reproductive system microbes may be useful resources for the promotion of animal health. Video Abstract Graphical Abstract",Microbiome,,(Meta)transcriptomics,Health & Disease
334,2023,Characterization of Virulent T4-Like Acinetobacter baumannii Bacteriophages DLP1 and DLP2,"The world is currently facing a global health crisis due to the rapid increase in antimicrobial-resistant bacterial infections. One of the most concerning pathogens is Acinetobacter baumannii, which is listed as a Priority 1 pathogen by the World Health Organization. This Gram-negative bacterium has many intrinsic antibiotic resistance mechanisms and the ability to quickly acquire new resistance determinants from its environment. A limited number of effective antibiotics against this pathogen complicates the treatment of A. baumannii infections. A potential treatment option that is rapidly gaining interest is “phage therapy”, or the clinical application of bacteriophages to selectively kill bacteria. The myoviruses DLP1 and DLP2 (vB_AbaM-DLP_1 and vB_AbaM-DLP_2, respectively) were isolated from sewage samples using a capsule minus variant of A. baumannii strain AB5075. Host range analysis of these phages against 107 A. baumannii strains shows a limited host range, infecting 15 and 21 for phages DLP1 and DLP2, respectively. Phage DLP1 has a large burst size of 239 PFU/cell, a latency period of 20 min, and virulence index of 0.93. In contrast, DLP2 has a smaller burst size of 24 PFU/cell, a latency period of 20 min, and virulence index of 0.86. Both phages show potential for use as therapeutics to combat A. baumannii infections.","Bacteria, Virus, Pathogen","Isolate, AMR, Variant",,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

336,2023,Shifts from cooperative to individual-based predation defense determine microbial predator-prey dynamics,"Predation defense is an important feature of predator-prey interactions adding complexity to ecosystem dynamics. Prey organisms have developed various strategies to escape predation which differ in mode (elude vs. attack), reversibility (inducible vs. permanent), and scope (individual vs. cooperative defenses). While the mechanisms and controls of many singular defenses are well understood, important ecological and evolutionary facets impacting long-term predator-prey dynamics remain underexplored. This pertains especially to trade-offs and interactions between alternative defenses occurring in prey populations evolving under predation pressure. Here, we explored the dynamics of a microbial predator-prey system consisting of bacterivorous flagellates ( Poteriospumella lacustris ) feeding on Pseudomonas putida . Within five weeks of co-cultivation corresponding to about 35 predator generations, we observed a consistent succession of bacterial defenses in all replicates ( n  = 16). Initially, bacteria expressed a highly effective cooperative defense based on toxic metabolites, which brought predators close to extinction. This initial strategy, however, was consistently superseded by a second mechanism of predation defense emerging via de novo mutations. Combining experiments with mathematical modeling, we demonstrate how this succession of defenses is driven by the maximization of individual rather than population benefits, highlighting the role of rapid evolution in the breakdown of social cooperation.",Bacteria,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, Interactome",Metabolomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
337,2023,Isolation and characterization of a novel Tenacibaculum species and a corresponding bacteriophage from a Mediterranean fish hatchery: Description of Tenacibaculum larymnensis sp. nov. and Tenacibaculum phage Larrie,"Tenacibaculum larymnensis sp. nov., a novel species of the Tenacibaculum genus was isolated from a commercial fish hatchery in Greece. The novel species is phylogenetically close to T. discolor and was biochemically and genetically characterized. The genome of T. larymnensis has 3.66 Mbps length, 31.83% GC content and the genomic analysis demonstrated that it harbors a wide enzymatic repertoire suggestive of increased degrading capacity but also several virulence factors including hemolysins, secretion systems, transporters, siderophores, pili and extracellular proteins. Using the novel strain, a virulent bacteriophage designated as Tenacibaculum phage Larrie was isolated and characterized. Larrie is a novel Siphovirus with relatively large genome, 77.5 kbps with 111 ORFs, a GC content of 33.7% and an exclusively lytic lifestyle.

338,2023,Adaptations of Pseudoxylaria towards a comb-associated lifestyle in fungus-farming termite colonies,"Characterizing ancient clades of fungal symbionts is necessary for understanding the evolutionary process underlying symbiosis development. In this study, we investigated a distinct subgeneric taxon of Xylaria ( Xylariaceae ), named Pseudoxylaria , whose members have solely been isolated from the fungus garden of farming termites. Pseudoxylaria are inconspicuously present in active fungus gardens of termite colonies and only emerge in the form of vegetative stromata, when the fungus comb is no longer attended (“sit and wait” strategy). Insights into the genomic and metabolic consequences of their association, however, have remained sparse. Capitalizing on viable Pseudoxylaria cultures from different termite colonies, we obtained genomes of seven and transcriptomes of two Pseudoxylaria isolates. Using a whole-genome-based comparison with free-living members of the genus Xylaria, we document that the association has been accompanied by significant reductions in genome size, protein-coding gene content, and reduced functional capacities related to oxidative lignin degradation, oxidative stress responses and secondary metabolite production. Functional studies based on growth assays and fungus-fungus co-cultivations, coupled with isotope fractionation analysis, showed that Pseudoxylaria only moderately antagonizes growth of the termite food fungus Termitomyces , and instead extracts nutrients from the food fungus biomass for its own growth. We also uncovered that Pseudoxylaria is still capable of producing structurally unique metabolites, which was exemplified by the isolation of two novel metabolites, and that the natural product repertoire correlated with antimicrobial and insect antifeedant activity.",,"Isolate, Functional analysis, AMR","(Meta)genomics, (Meta)transcriptomics, Metabolomics",Health & Disease
339,2023,Population genomics-guided engineering of phenazine biosynthesis in Pseudomonas chlororaphis,"The emergence of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has made it possible to not only sequence entire genomes, but also identify metabolic engineering targets across the pangenome of a microbial population. This study leverages NGS data as well as existing molecular biology and bioinformatics tools to identify and validate genomic signatures for improving phenazine biosynthesis in Pseudomonas chlororaphis. We sequenced a diverse collection of 34 Pseudomonas isolates using short- and long-read sequencing techniques and assembled whole genomes using the NGS reads. In addition, we assayed three industrially relevant phenotypes (phenazine production, biofilm formation, and growth temperature) for these isolates in two different media conditions. We then provided the whole genomes and phenazine production data to a unitig-based microbial genome-wide association study (mGWAS) tool to identify novel genomic signatures responsible for phenazine production in P. chlororaphis. Post-processing of the mGWAS analysis results yielded 330 significant hits influencing the biosynthesis of one or more phenazine compounds. Based on a quantitative metric (called the phenotype score), we elucidated the most influential hits for phenazine production and experimentally validated them in vivo in the most optimal phenazine producing strain. Two genes significantly increased phenazine-1-carboxamide (PCN) production: a histidine transporter (ProY_1), and a putative carboxypeptidase (PS__04251). A putative MarR-family transcriptional regulator decreased PCN titer when overexpressed in a high PCN producing isolate. Overall, this work seeks to demonstrate the utility of a population genomics approach as an effective strategy in enabling identification of targets for metabolic engineering of bioproduction hosts.",,Isolate,(Meta)genomics,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
340,2023,Antarctic Ardley Island terrace — An ideal place to study the marine to terrestrial succession of microbial communities,"The study of chronosequences is an effective tool to study the effects of environmental changes or disturbances on microbial community structures, diversity, and the functional properties of ecosystems. Here, we conduct a chronosequence study on the Ardley Island coastal terrace of the Fildes Peninsula, Maritime Antarctica. The results revealed that prokaryotic microorganism communities changed orderly among the six successional stages. Some marine microbial groups could still be found in near-coastal soils of the late stage (lowest stratum). Animal pathogenic bacteria and stress-resistant microorganisms occurred at the greatest level with the longest succession period. The main driving factors for the succession of bacteria, archaea, and fungi along Ardley Island terrace were found through Adonis analysis (PERMANOVA). During analysis, soil elements Mg, Si, and Na were related to the bacterial and archaeal community structure discrepancies, while Al, Ti, K, and Cl were related to the fungal community structure discrepancies. On the other hand, other environmental factors also play an important role in the succession of microbial communities, which could be different among each microorganism. The succession of bacterial communities is greatly affected by pH and water content; archaeal communities are greatly affected by NH4+; fungal communities are affected by nutrients such as NO3−. In the analysis of the characteristic microorganisms along terrace, the succession of microorganisms was found to be influenced by complex and comprehensive factors. For instance, environmental instability, relationship with plants and ecological niches, and environmental tolerance. The results found that budding reproduction and/or with filamentous appendages bacteria were enriched in the late stage, which might be connected to its tolerance to rapid changes and barren environments. In addition, the decline in ammonia oxidation capacity of Thaumarchaeota archaeade with succession and the evolution of the fungi-plant relationship throughout classes were revealed. Overall, this research improves the understanding of the effect of the marine–to–terrestrial transition of the Ardley Island terrace on microbial communities. These findings will lay the foundation for more in-depth research regarding microbial adaptations and evolutionary mechanisms throughout the marine–terrestrial transition in the future.","Bacteria, Archaea, Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, AMR",,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
341,2023,"Impact of Pipe Material and Temperature on Drinking Water Microbiome and Prevalence of Legionella, Mycobacterium, and Pseudomonas Species","In drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs), pipe material and water temperature are some of the critical factors affecting the microbial flora of water. Six model DWDSs consisting of three pipe materials (galvanized steel, copper, and PEX) were constructed. The temperature in three systems was maintained at 22 °C and the other 3 at 32 °C to study microbial and elemental contaminants in a 6-week survey using 16S rRNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Pipe material and temperature were preferentially linked with the composition of trace elements and the microbiome of the DWDSs, respectively. Proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum across all water samples ranging from 60.9% to 91.1%. Species richness (alpha diversity) ranking was PEX < steel ≤ copper system and elevated temperature resulted in decreased alpha diversity. Legionellaceae were omni-prevalent, while Mycobacteriaceae were more prevalent at 32 °C (100% vs. 58.6%) and Pseudomonadaceae at 22 °C (53.3% vs. 62.9%). Heterogeneity between communities was disproportionately driven by the pipe material and water temperature. The elevated temperature resulted in well-defined microbial clusters (high pseudo-F index) in all systems, with the highest impact in PEX (10.928) followed by copper (9.696) and steel (5.448). Legionellaceae and Mycobacteriaceae are preferentially prevalent in warmer waters. The results suggest that the water temperature has a higher magnitude of impact on the microbiome than the pipe material.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
342,2023,Characterizing the gut microbiome changes with aging in a novel Alzheimer’s disease rat model,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most devastating diseases currently in the world with no effective treatments. There is increasing evidence that the gut microbiome plays a role in AD. Here we set out to study the age-related changes in the microbiome of the Tgf344-AD rats. We performed 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing on the fecal samples of male rats at 14 and 20 months of age. We found the Tgf344-AD rats to have decreased microbial diversity compared to controls at 14 months of age and this was found to be opposite at 20 months of age. Interestingly, we found a distinctive shift in the microbial community structure of the rats with aging along with changes in the microbiota composition. Some of the observed changes in the Tgf344AD rats were in the genera Bifidobacterium, Ruminococcus, Parasutterella, Lachnoclostridium and Butyricicoccus. Other age-related changes occuring in both the Tgf344-AD and WT control rats were decreases in Enterohaldus, Escherichia Shigella, Rothia and increase in Turicibacter and Clostrium_senso_stricto.

The disease is usually caused by Legionella pneumophila, but other species have been implicated in the infection. The disease is frequently manifested as an outbreak, which means several people are affected when exposed to the common source of Legionella contamination. Therefor environmental surveillance which includes isolation and identification of Legionella is performed routinely. However, usually no molecular or genome-based methods are employed in further characterization of the isolates during routine environmental monitoring. During several years of such monitoring, isolates from different geographical locations were collected and 39 of them were sequenced by hybrid de novo approach utilizing short and long sequencing reads. In addition, the isolates were typed by standard culture and MALDI-TOF method. The sequencing reads were assembled and annotated to produce high-quality genomes. By employing discriminatory genome typing, four potential new species in the Legionella genus were identified, which are yet to be biochemically and morphologically characterized. Moreover, functional annotations concerning virulence and antimicrobial resistance were performed on the sequenced genomes. The study contributes to the knowledge on little-known non-pneumophila species present in man-made water systems and establishes support for future genetic relatedness studies as well as understanding of their pathogenic potential.","Bacteria, Pathogen","Isolate, Functional analysis, AMR, Annotation",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

However, in most cases, the mechanisms of action remain unknown. The antifungal potential of LBM has already been demonstrated using preclinical models (cell cultures, laboratory animals). Understanding their mechanisms of action is strategic for the development of new therapeutics for humans. Here, Caenorhabditis elegans was used as an in vivo model to analyze pro-longevity, anti-aging and anti-candidiasis effects of the LBM Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus (formerly Lactobacillus rhamnosus) Lcr35®. A high-throughput transcriptomic analysis revealed a specific response of C. elegans depending on whether it is in the presence of the LBM L. rhamnosus Lcr35® (structural response), the yeast Candida albicans (metabolic response) or both (structural and metabolic responses) in a preventive and a curative conditions. Studies on C. elegans mutants demonstrated that the p38 MAPK (sek-1, skn-1) and the insulin-like (daf-2, daf-16) signaling pathways were involved in the extended lifespan provided by L. rhamnosus Lcr35® strain whereas the JNK pathway was not involved (jnk-1). In addition, the anti C. albicans effect of the bacterium requires the daf-16 and sek-1 genes while it is independent of daf-2 and skn-1. Moreover, the anti-aging effect of Lcr35®, linked to the extension of longevity, is not due to protection against oxidative stress (H2O2). Taken together, these results formally show the involvement of the p38 MAP kinase and insulin-like signaling pathways for the longevity extension and anti-Candida albicans properties of Lcr35® with, however, differences in the genes involved.

346,2022,Performing in spite of starvation: How Saccharomyces cerevisiae maintains robust growth when facing famine zones in industrial bioreactors,"In fed‐batch operated industrial bioreactors, glucose‐limited feeding is commonly applied for optimal control of cell growth and product formation. Still, microbial cells such as yeasts and bacteria are frequently exposed to glucose starvation conditions in poorly mixed zones or far away from the feedstock inlet point. Despite its commonness, studies mimicking related stimuli are still underrepresented in scale‐up/scale‐down considerations. This may surprise as the transition from glucose limitation to starvation has the potential to provoke regulatory responses with negative consequences for production performance. In order to shed more light, we performed gene‐expression analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown in intermittently fed chemostat cultures to study the effect of limitation‐starvation transitions. The resulting glucose concentration gradient was representative for the commercial scale and compelled cells to tolerate about 76 s with sub‐optimal substrate supply. Special attention was paid to the adaptation status of the population by discriminating between first time and repeated entry into the starvation regime. Unprepared cells reacted with a transiently reduced growth rate governed by the general stress response. Yeasts adapted to the dynamic environment by increasing internal growth capacities at the cost of rising maintenance demands by 2.7%. Evidence was found that multiple protein kinase A (PKA) and Snf1‐mediated regulatory circuits were initiated and ramped down still keeping the cells in an adapted trade‐off between growth optimization and down‐regulation of stress response. From this finding, primary engineering guidelines are deduced to optimize both the production host's genetic background and the design of scale‐down experiments.",Bacteria,,,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
347,2022,Discovery and biosynthetic assessment of 'Streptomyces ortus' sp. nov. isolated from a deep-sea sponge,"The deep sea is known to host novel bacteria with the potential to produce a diverse array of undiscovered natural products. Understanding these bacteria is thus of broad interest in ecology and could also underpin applied drug discovery, specifically in the area of antimicrobials. Here, we isolate a new strain of Streptomyces from the tissue of the deep-sea sponge Polymastia corticata collected at a depth of 1869 m from the Gramberg seamount in the Atlantic Ocean. This strain, which was given the initial designation A15ISP2-DRY2T, has a genome size of 9.29 Mb with a GC content of 70.83%. Phylogenomics determined that A15ISP2-DRY2T represents a novel species within the genus Streptomyces as part of the Streptomyces aurantiacus clade. The biosynthetic potential of A15ISP2-DRY2T was assessed relative to other members of the aurantiacus clade via comparative gene cluster family (GCF) analysis. This revealed a clear congruent relationship between phylogeny and GCF content. A15ISP2-DRY2T contains six unique GCFs absent elsewhere in the clade. Culture-based assays were used to demonstrate the antibacterial activity of A15ISP2-DRY2T against two drug-resistant human pathogens. We thus determine A15ISP2-DRY2T to be a novel bacterial species with considerable biosynthetic potential and propose the systematic name Streptomyces ortus sp. nov. Impact Statement The Streptomyces genus has contributed more to our antibiotic arsenal than any other group of bacteria or fungi. Despite decades of exploration, global analysis has suggested they still possess more undiscovered biosynthetic diversity than any other bacterial group. Isolating novel species of Streptomyces is therefore a priority for antibiotic discovery. Here we isolate a novel strain from a deep-sea sponge and use comparative cluster analysis to identify six biosynthetic clusters unique to our deep-sea strain. This work demonstrates the utility of continuing to isolate novel Streptomyces strains for antibiotic discovery and, for the first time, we used species tree-gene cluster tree reconciliation to assess the contribution of vertical evolution on the biosynthetic gene cluster content of Streptomyces.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR, Comparative analysis",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
348,2022,Micronutrient Biosynthesis Potential of Spontaneous Grain Fermentation Microbiomes,"Fermented foods play an important role in the human diet and particularly so in under-resourced environments where cold preservation is not attainable due to irregular supply of electricity. Fermented foods are reported to support gut health by contributing probiotics. The purpose of this study was to investigate the microbial diversity and metabolic potential of spontaneous millet fermentation. The literature in the field was reviewed and analyses were conducted on publicly available Sequence Read Archive (SRA) datasets. Quality analysis was performed with FastQC, and operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were generated using Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME2) and Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm (DADA2) pipelines with Greengenes as the reference database. Metagenomics and pathways analysis were performed with Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt2). Statistical analysis and visualization were accomplished with Statistical Analysis of Metagenomic Profiles (STAMP). At the family taxonomic level, there were differences in the relative abundances of the dominant taxa of bacteria that are involved in the spontaneous fermentation of millet namely Lactobacillaceae, Burkholderiaceae, Streptococcaceae, Leuconostocaceae, and Acetobacteraceae. Clostridiaceae was the dominant family in one dataset. The incidence of Lactobacillaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae suggest the probiotic characteristics of fermented millet. The datasets were collected with fermentations that were mediated by autochthonous microorganisms and the presence of some potential pathogens such as Enterobacteriaceae, Clostridiaceae, Aeromonadaceae, Microbacteiaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and Neisseriaceae which suggest the need for standardization of fermentation approaches. The genomes show the potential to synthesize metabolites such as essential amino acids and vitamins, suggesting that the respective fermented foods can be further optimized to enhance nutritional benefits.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen",Community (taxonomy) profiling,"Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics, Metabolomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
349,2022,Low microbiome diversity in threatened amphibians from two biodiversity hotspots,"Microbial diversity positively influences community resilience of the host microbiome. However, extinction risk factors such as habitat specialization, narrow environmental tolerances, and exposure to anthropogenic disturbance may homogenize host-associated microbial communities critical for stress responses including disease defense. In a dataset containing 43 threatened and 90 non-threatened amphibian species across two biodiversity hotspots (Brazil’s Atlantic Forest and Madagascar), we found that threatened host species carried lower skin bacterial diversity, after accounting for key environmental and host factors. The consistency of our findings across continents suggests the broad scale at which low bacteriome diversity may compromise pathogen defenses in species already burdened with the threat of extinction.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen",Community (taxonomy) profiling,,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
350,2022,Amoxicillin and thiamphenicol treatments may influence the co-selection of resistance genes in the chicken gut microbiota,"The aim of this study was to assess the dynamics of microbial communities and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in the chicken gut following amoxicillin and thiamphenicol treatments and potential co-selection of ARGs. To this purpose, the microbial community composition, using 16S rRNA NGS, and the abundance of ARGs conferring resistance to β-lactams and phenicols, using qPCRs, were determined. Results revealed that the administered antimicrobials did not significantly reduce the gut microbiota diversity, but changed its composition, with taxa (e.g. Gallibacterium and Megamonas) being enriched after treatment and replacing other bacteria (e.g. Streptococcus and Bifidobacterium). Positive correlations were found between ARGs (e.g. cmlA, blaCMY-2, and blaSHV) and the relative abundance of specific taxa (e.g. Lactobacillus and Subdoligranulum). The selective pressure exerted by both amoxicillin and thiamphenicol resulted in an increased abundance of ARGs conferring resistance to β-lactams (e.g. blaTEM-1, blaSHV, and blaCTX-M1-like) and phenicols (e.g. floR and cmlA). These findings, together with the co-occurrence of genes conferring resistance to the two antimicrobial classes (e.g. blaTEM-1 and cmlA), suggest a possible interaction among antimicrobials on resistance emergence, possibly due to the presence of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) carrying multiple resistance determinants.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Interactome, AMR",Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
351,2022,Ear mite infection restructures otic microbial networks in conservation–reliant Santa Catalina Island foxes (Urocyon littoralis catalinae),"Ceruminous gland tumours are highly prevalent in the ear canals of Santa Catalina Island foxes (Urocyon littoralis catalinae). Previous work suggests that tumours may result from a combination of ectoparasites, disruption of the host‐associated microbiome, and host immunopathology. More specifically, ear mite infection has been associated with broad‐scale microbial dysbiosis marked by secondary bacterial infection with the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. Together, ear mites and S. pseudintermedius probably sustain chronic inflammation and promote conditions suitable for tumour development. In the present study, we expanded upon this framework by constructing otic microbial community networks for mite‐infected and uninfected foxes sampled in 2017–2019. Across sampling years, we observed consistent signatures of microbial dysbiosis in mite‐infected ear canals, including reduced microbial diversity and shifted abundance towards S. pseudintermedius. Network analysis further revealed that mite infection disrupts overall community structure. In mite‐infected networks, interaction strengths between taxa were generally weaker, and numerous subnetworks disappeared altogether. We also found that two strains of S. pseudintermedius connected to the main network, suggesting that multistrain biofilm formation may be occurring. In contrast, S. pseudintermedius is peripheral in the uninfected network, with its only connections including a second strain of S. pseudintermedius and the possible competitor Acinetobacter rhizosphaerae. Finally, the lineup of potential keystone taxa shifted across disease states. Fusobacteria spp., a carcinogenesis‐promoting microbe, assumed a keystone role in the mite‐infected community. Considered together, these findings provide insights into how mite infection may destabilize the microbiome and ultimately contribute to tumour development in this island endemic species.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Interactome",,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

353,2022,Host-Mediated Copper Stress Is Not Protective against Streptococcus pneumoniae D39 Infection,"Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is one of the world’s foremost bacterial pathogens. Treatment of both localized and systemic pneumococcal infection is becoming complicated by increasing rates of multidrug resistance globally. ABSTRACT Metal ions are required by all organisms for the chemical processes that support life. However, in excess they can also exert toxicity within biological systems. During infection, bacterial pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae are exposed to host-imposed metal intoxication, where the toxic properties of metals, such as copper, are exploited to aid in microbial clearance. However, previous studies investigating the antimicrobial efficacy of copper in vivo have reported variable findings. Here, we use a highly copper-sensitive strain of S. pneumoniae, lacking both copper efflux and intracellular copper buffering by glutathione, to investigate how copper stress is managed and where it is encountered during infection. We show that this strain exhibits highly dysregulated copper homeostasis, leading to the attenuation of growth and hyperaccumulation of copper in vitro. In a murine infection model, whole-tissue copper quantitation and elemental bioimaging of the murine lung revealed that infection with S. pneumoniae resulted in increased copper abundance in specific tissues, with the formation of spatially discrete copper hot spots throughout the lung. While the increased copper was able to reduce the viability of the highly copper-sensitive strain in a pneumonia model, copper levels in professional phagocytes and in a bacteremic model were insufficient to prosecute bacterial clearance. Collectively, this study reveals that host copper is redistributed to sites of infection and can impact bacterial viability in a hypersusceptible strain. However, in wild-type S. pneumoniae, the concerted actions of the copper homeostatic mechanisms are sufficient to facilitate continued viability and virulence of the pathogen. IMPORTANCE Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is one of the world’s foremost bacterial pathogens. Treatment of both localized and systemic pneumococcal infection is becoming complicated by increasing rates of multidrug resistance globally. Copper is a potent antimicrobial agent used by the mammalian immune system in the defense against bacterial pathogens. However, unlike other bacterial species, this copper stress is unable to prosecute pneumococcal clearance. This study determines how the mammalian host inflicts copper stress on S. pneumoniae and the bacterial copper tolerance mechanisms that contribute to maintenance of viability and virulence in vitro and in vivo. This work has provided insight into the chemical biology of the host-pneumococcal interaction and identified a potential avenue for novel antimicrobial development.","Bacteria, Pathogen","Interactome, AMR",Imaging,Health & Disease
354,2022,Specialized Metabolism of Gordonia Genus: An Integrated Survey on Chemodiversity Combined with a Comparative Genomics-Based Analysis,"Members of the phylum Actinomycetota (formerly Actinobacteria) have historically been the most prolific providers of small bioactive molecules. Although the genus Streptomyces is the best-known member for this issue, other genera, such as Gordonia, have shown interesting potential in their specialized metabolism. Thus, we combined herein the result of a comprehensive literature survey on metabolites derived from Gordonia strains with a comparative genomic analysis to examine the potential of the specialized metabolism of the genus Gordonia. Thirty Gordonia-derived compounds of different classes were gathered (i.e., alkaloids, amides, phenylpropanoids, and terpenoids), exhibiting antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities, and several were also isolated from Streptomyces (e.g., actinomycin, nocardamin, diolmycin A1). With the genome data, we estimated an open pan-genome of 57,901 genes, most of them being part of the cloud genome. Regarding the BGCs content, 531 clusters were found, including Terpenes, RiPP-like, and NRPS clusters as the most frequent clusters. Our findings demonstrated that Gordonia is a poorly studied genus in terms of its specialized metabolism production and potential applications. Nevertheless, given their BGCs content, Gordonia spp. are a valuable biological resource that could expand the chemical spectrum of the phylum Actinomycetota, involving novel BGCs for inspiring innovative outlines for synthetic biology and further use in biotechnological initiatives. Therefore, further studies and more efforts should be made to explore different environments and evaluate other bioactivities.",Bacteria,"Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR, Comparative analysis","(Meta)genomics, Metabolomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
355,2022,Functional and Safety Characterization of Weissella paramesenteroides Strains Isolated from Dairy Products through Whole-Genome Sequencing and Comparative Genomics,"Strains belonging to the Weissella genus are frequently recovered from spontaneously fermented foods. Their functional, microbial-modulating, and probiotic traits enhance not only the sensorial properties but also the nutritional value, beneficial effects, and safety of fermented products. Sporadic cases of opportunistic pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance have deprived safety status from all Weissella species, which thus remain understudied. Our study increased the number of available high-quality and taxonomically accurate W. paramesenteroides genomes by 25% (9 genomes reported, leading to a total of 36 genomes). We conducted a phylogenetic and comparative genomic analysis of the most dominant Weissella species (W. cibaria, W. paramesenteroides, W. viridescens, W. soli, W. koreensis, W. hellenica and W. thailadensis). The phylogenetic tree corroborated species assignment but also revealed phylogenetic diversity within the Weissella species, which is likely related to the adaptation of Weissella in different niches. Using robust alignment criteria, we showed the overall absence of resistance and virulence genes in Weissella spp., except for one W. cibaria isolate carrying blaTEM-181. Enrichment analysis showed the association of Weissella species several CAZymes, which are essential for biotechnological applications. Additionally, the combination of CAZyme metabolites with probiotics can potentially lead to beneficial effects for hosts, such as the inhibition of inflammatory processes and the reduction of cholesterol levels. Bacteriocins and mobile genetic elements MGEs (Inc11 plasmid and ISS1N insertion sequence) were less abundant, however W. thailadensis and W. viridescens showed significant association with specific bacteriocin-encoding genes. Lastly, an analysis of phenotypic traits underlined the need to carefully evaluate W. cibaria strains before use as food additives and suggested the possibility of employing W. paramesenteroides and W. hellenica in the fermentation process of vegetable products. More studies providing high-resolution characterization of Weissella strains from various sources are necessary to elucidate the safety of Weissella spp. and exploit their beneficial characteristics.","Bacteria, Pathogen","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, AMR, Comparative analysis","(Meta)genomics, Metabolomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
356,2022,"High diversity of benthic cyanobacterial mats on coral reefs of Koh Tao, Gulf of Thailand","Benthic cyanobacterial mats are increasingly reported to cover major coral reef areas. Although suggestions have been made that cyanobacterial mats impair coral reef health in multiple ways, information is lacking regarding the distribution, morphotypical variation and bacterial species composition of these microbial mats. As such, this study aimed to (1) Reveal the bacterial community diversity and composition of different mat morphotypes, (2) Identify the most abundant community members and closely related organisms, (3) Assess to what extent, morphotype, colonized substrate (coral or abiotic substrate), depth, and site were significant predictors of bacterial composition. Data were collected on reefs surrounding the island of Koh Tao (Gulf of Thailand). A total of 201 mats from 16 different locations around the island were classified into eight distinct morphotypes. Of these, the bacterial communities of 44 mats, representing colour groups from multiple sites, were characterized using 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing. Our data revealed that Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Bacteriodetes and Planctomycetes were the four most abundant phyla and occurred in all samples. Abundant cyanobacterial zero-radius operational taxonomic units (ZOTUs) were closely related to prokaryotic sequences found in previous studies of coastal mats (98–100%) and were assigned to genera in the order Oscillatoriales, e.g. Hormoscilla , Okeania , and Oscillatoria . Abundant proteobacterial ZOTUs were assigned to orders in the classes Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria, e.g. Rhodobacterales, Rhizobiales and Alteromonadales. Abundant Bacteriodetes ZOTUs were mainly assigned to the class Bacteroidia and order Cytophagales. Our results showed that mats consist of a diverse and variable bacterial consortium, with mat colour (morphotype), substrate type and geographic location only explaining a small part of the total variation in composition.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

358,2022,"Monochloramine Induces Release of DNA and RNA from Bacterial Cells: Quantification, Sequencing Analyses, and Implications.","Monochloramine (MCA) is a widely used secondary disinfectant to suppress microbial growth in drinking water distribution systems. In monochloraminated drinking water, a significant amount of extracellular DNA (eDNA) has been reported, which has many implications ranging from obscuring DNA-based drinking water microbiome analyses to posing potential health concerns. To address this, it is imperative for us to know the origin of the eDNA in drinking water. Using Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a model organism, we report for the first time that MCA induces the release of nucleic acids from both biofilms and planktonic cells. Upon exposure to 2 mg/L MCA, massive release of DNA from suspended cells in both MilliQ water and 0.9% NaCl was directly visualized using live cell imaging in a CellASIC ONIX2 microfluidic system. Exposing established biofilms to MCA also resulted in DNA release from the biofilms, which was confirmed by increased detection of eDNA in the effluent. Intriguingly, massive release of RNA was also observed, and the extracellular RNA (eRNA) was also found to persist in water for days. Sequencing analyses of the eDNA revealed that it could be used to assemble the whole genome of the model organism, while in the water, certain fragments of the genome were more persistent than others. RNA sequencing showed that the eRNA contains non-coding RNA and mRNA, implying its role as a possible signaling molecule in environmental systems and a snapshot of the past metabolic state of the bacterial cells.","Bacteria, Microbiome",,"(Meta)genomics, Imaging","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

361,2022,The rate and role of pseudogenes of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex,"Whole-genome sequence analyses have significantly contributed to the understanding of virulence and evolution of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), the causative pathogens of tuberculosis. Most MTBC evolutionary studies are focused on single nucleotide polymorphisms and deletions, but rare studies have evaluated gene content, whereas none has comprehensively evaluated pseudogenes. Accordingly, we describe an extensive study focused on quantifying and predicting possible functions of MTBC and Mycobacterium canettii pseudogenes. Using NCBI’s PGAP-detected pseudogenes, we analysed 25 837 pseudogenes from 158 MTBC and M. canetii strains and combined transcriptomics and proteomics of M. tuberculosis H37Rv to gain insights about pseudogenes' expression. Our results indicate significant variability concerning rate and conservancy of in silico predicted pseudogenes among different ecotypes and lineages of tuberculous mycobacteria and pseudogenization of important virulence factors and genes of the metabolism and antimicrobial resistance/tolerance. We show that in silico predicted pseudogenes contribute considerably to MTBC genetic diversity at the population level. Moreover, the transcription machinery of M. tuberculosis can fully transcribe most pseudogenes, indicating intact promoters and recent pseudogene evolutionary emergence. Proteomics of M. tuberculosis and close evaluation of mutational lesions driving pseudogenization suggest that few in silico predicted pseudogenes are likely capable of neofunctionalization, nonsense mutation reversal, or phase variation, contradicting the classical definition of pseudogenes. Such findings indicate that genome annotation should be accompanied by proteomics and protein function assays to improve its accuracy. While indels and insertion sequences are the main drivers of the observed mutational lesions in these species, population bottlenecks and genetic drift are likely the evolutionary processes acting on pseudogenes' emergence over time. Our findings unveil a new perspective on MTBC’s evolution and genetic diversity.","Bacteria, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, AMR, Annotation","(Meta)genomics, (Meta)transcriptomics, (Meta)proteomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
362,2022,Mycobacterium Time-Series Genome Analysis Identifies AAC2′ as a Potential Drug Target with Naloxone Showing Potential Bait Drug Synergism,"The World Health Organization has put drug resistance in tuberculosis on its list of significant threats, with a critical emphasis on resolving the genetic differences in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This provides an opportunity for a better understanding of the evolutionary progression leading to anti-microbial resistance. Anti-microbial resistance has a great impact on the economic stability of the global healthcare sector. We performed a timeline genomic analysis from 2003 to 2021 of 578 mycobacterium genomes to understand the pattern underlying genomic variations. Potential drug targets based on functional annotation was subjected to pharmacophore-based screening of FDA-approved phyto-actives. Reaction search, MD simulations, and metadynamics studies were performed. A total of 4,76,063 mutations with a transition/transversion ratio of 0.448 was observed. The top 10 proteins with the least number of mutations were high-confidence drug targets. Aminoglycoside 2′-N-acetyltransferase protein (AAC2′), conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, was shortlisted as a potential drug target based on its function and role in bait drug synergism. Gentamicin-AAC2′ binding pose was used as a pharmacophore template to screen 10,570 phyto-actives. A total of 66 potential hits were docked to obtain naloxone as a lead—active with a docking score of −6.317. Naloxone is an FDA-approved drug that rapidly reverses opioid overdose. This is a classic case of a repurposed phyto-active. Naloxone consists of an amine group, but the addition of the acetyl group is unfavorable, with a reaction energy of 612.248 kcal/mol. With gentamicin as a positive control, molecular dynamic simulation studies were performed for 200 ns to check the stability of binding. Metadynamics-based studies were carried out to compare unbinding energy with gentamicin. The unbinding energies were found to be −68 and −74 kcal/mol for naloxone and gentamycin, respectively.

Here, we attempted to alleviate chemically induced colitis using a lactococci strain that either directly expressed the precursor to LL37, hCAP18 (LL-pSEC:hCAP18), or delivered hCAP18 cDNA to host cells under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (LL-Probi-H1:hCAP18). We also investigated whether the alleviation of symptoms could be explained through modification of the gut microbiota by hCAP18. Mice were administered daily doses of LL-pSEC:hCAP18 or LL-Probi-H1:hCAP18. On day 7, colitis was induced by DNBS. During autopsy, we assessed macroscopic tissue damage in the colon and collected tissue samples for the characterization of inflammation markers and histological analysis. Feces were collected at day 7 for 16S DNA sequencing. We also performed a fecal transplant experiment in which mice underwent colon washing and received feces from Lactococcus lactis-treated mice before DNBS-colitis induction. Treatment with LL-Probi-H1:hCAP18 reduced the severity of colitis symptoms. The protective effects were accompanied by increased levels of IL17A and IL10 in mesenteric lymph node cells. L. lactis administration altered the abundance of Lachnospiraceae and Muribaculaceae.

364,2022,Redox-Mediated Inactivation of the Transcriptional Repressor RcrR is Responsible for Uropathogenic Escherichia coli’s Increased Resistance to Reactive Chlorine Species,"How do pathogens deal with antimicrobial oxidants produced by the innate immune system during infection? Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), the most common etiological agent of urinary tract infections (UTIs), is particularly exposed to infiltrating neutrophils and, therefore, must counter elevated levels of the antimicrobial oxidant HOCl to establish infection. Our study provides fundamentally new insights into a defense mechanism that enables UPEC to fend off the toxic effects of HOCl stress. ABSTRACT The ability to overcome stressful environments is critical for pathogen survival in the host. One challenge for bacteria is the exposure to reactive chlorine species (RCS), which are generated by innate immune cells as a critical part of the oxidative burst. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is the most potent antimicrobial RCS and is associated with extensive macromolecular damage in the phagocytized pathogen. However, bacteria have evolved defense strategies to alleviate the effects of HOCl-mediated damage. Among these are RCS-sensing transcriptional regulators that control the expression of HOCl-protective genes under non-stress and HOCl stress. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), the major causative agent of urinary tract infections (UTIs), is particularly exposed to infiltrating neutrophils during pathogenesis; however, their responses to and defenses from HOCl are still completely unexplored. Here, we present evidence that UPEC strains tolerate higher levels of HOCl and are better protected from neutrophil-mediated killing compared with other E. coli. Transcriptomic analysis of HOCl-stressed UPEC revealed the upregulation of an operon consisting of three genes, one of which encodes the transcriptional regulator RcrR. We identified RcrR as a HOCl-responsive transcriptional repressor, which, under non-stress conditions, is bound to the operator and represses the expression of its target genes. During HOCl exposure, however, the repressor forms reversible intermolecular disulfide bonds and dissociates from the DNA resulting in the derepression of the operon. Deletion of one of the target genes renders UPEC significantly more susceptible to HOCl and phagocytosis indicating that the HOCl-mediated induction of the regulon plays a major role for UPEC’s HOCl resistance. IMPORTANCE How do pathogens deal with antimicrobial oxidants produced by the innate immune system during infection? Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), the most common etiological agent of urinary tract infections (UTIs), is particularly exposed to infiltrating neutrophils and, therefore, must counter elevated levels of the antimicrobial oxidant HOCl to establish infection. Our study provides fundamentally new insights into a defense mechanism that enables UPEC to fend off the toxic effects of HOCl stress. Intriguingly, the defense system is predominantly found in UPEC and absent in noninvasive enteropathogenic E. coli. Our data suggest expression of the target gene rcrB is exclusively responsible for UPEC’s increased HOCl tolerance in culture and contributes to UPEC’s survival during phagocytosis. Thus, this novel HOCl stress defense system could potentially serve as an attractive drug target to increase the body’s own capacity to fight UTIs.","Bacteria, Pathogen",AMR,(Meta)transcriptomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

We proposed that functions of specific microbial species adjoining the mucus layer may directly impact the biology of CC. Method Metagenomes of rectal swabs in 41 CC patients were examined by whole-genome shotgun sequencing to link taxonomic structures, molecular functions, and metabolic pathway to patient’s clinical characteristics. Results Significant association of molecular functions encoded by the metagenomes was found with initial tumor size and stage. Profiling of the molecular function abundances and their distributions identified 2 microbial communities co-existing in each metagenome but having distinct metabolism and taxonomic structures. Community A ( Clostridia and Proteobacteria predominant) was characterized by high activity of pathways involved in stress response, mucus glycan degradation and utilization of degradation byproducts. This community was prevalent in patients with larger, advanced stage tumors. Conversely, community B ( Bacteroidia predominant) was characterized by fast growth, active oxidative phosphorylation, and production of vitamins. This community was prevalent in patients with smaller, early-stage tumors. Conclusions In this study, enrichment of mucus degrading microbial communities in rectal metagenomes of CC patients was associated with larger, more advanced stage tumors.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
366,2022,Year-Long Microbial Succession on Microplastics in Wastewater: Chaotic Dynamics Outweigh Preferential Growth,"Microplastics are a globally-ubiquitous aquatic pollutant and have been heavily studied over the last decade. Of particular interest are the interactions between microplastics and microorganisms, especially the pursuit to discover a plastic-specific biome, the so-called plastisphere. To follow this up, a year-long microcosm experimental setup was deployed to expose five different microplastic types (and silica beads control) to activated aerobic wastewater in controlled conditions, with microbial communities being measured four times over the course of the year using 16S rDNA (bacterial) and ITS (fungal) amplicon sequencing. The biofilm community shows no evidence of a specific plastisphere, even after a year of incubation. Indeed, the microbial communities (particularly bacterial) show a clear trend of increasing dissimilarity between plastic types as time increases. Despite little evidence for a plastic-specific community, there was a slight grouping observed for polyolefins (PE and PP) in 6–12-month biofilms. Additionally, an OTU assigned to the genus Devosia was identified on many plastics, increasing over time while showing no growth on silicate (natural particle) controls, suggesting this could be either a slow-growing plastic-specific taxon or a symbiont to such. Both substrate-associated findings were only possible to observe in samples incubated for 6–12 months, which highlights the importance of studying long-term microbial community dynamics on plastic surfaces.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Interactome",Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
367,2022,First detection of a colistin-resistant Klebsiella aerogenes isolate from a critically ill patient with septic shock in Bulgaria.,"Colistin is considered as the last-line antibiotic for the treatment of infections caused by extensively drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens belonging to the ESKAPE ( Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) group. The present study aimed to explore the colistin resistance mechanisms of a Klebsiella aerogenes (formerly Enterobacter aerogenes) isolate (Kae1177-1bg) obtained from a Bulgarian critically ill patient with septic shock in 2020. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and whole-genome sequencing using DNA nanoball technology were performed. The resulting read pairs were used for draft genome assembly, MLST analysis and mutation screening in the pmrA/B, phoP/Q, and mgrB genes. Kae1177-1bg demonstrated high-level resistance to colistin, resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins and susceptibility to all other antibiotics tested. In our strain a CMY-2-type class C cephalosporinase was the only β-lactamase identified. No mobile colistin resistance (mcr) genes were detected. A total of three missense variants in the genes for the two-component PmrA/PmrB system were identified. Two of them were located in the pmrB (pR57K and pN275K) and one in the pmrA gene (pL162M). The pN275K variant emerged as the most likely cause for colistin resistance because it affected a highly conservative position and was the only nonconservative amino acid substitution. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented clinical case of a high-level colistin-resistant K. aerogenes in Bulgaria and the first identification of the nonconservative amino acid substitution pN275K worldwide. Colistin-resistant Gram-negative pathogens of ESKAPE group are serious threat to public health and should be subjected to infection control stewardship practices.",Pathogen,"Isolate, AMR, MAGs, (M)LST, Variant",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease
368,2022,"Microplastics in soil induce a new microbial habitat, with consequences for bulk soil microbiomes","Microplastic (MP) pollution poses a threat to agricultural soils and may induce a significant loss of the soil quality and services provided by these ecosystems. Studies in marine environments suggest that this impact is mediated by shifts in the microbiome. However, studies on the mode of action of MP materials on the soil microbiome are rare, particularly when comparing the effects of different MP materials. In this study, we characterized the microbiota colonizing two different MP materials, granules made of polypropylene (PP) and expanded polystyrene (ePS), introduced into arable soil and incubated for 8 weeks using a molecular barcoding approach. We further assessed the consequences on the microbiome of bulk soil. The complexity of the bacterial communities colonizing MP materials was significantly higher on ePS compared to PP. Many of the detected genera colonizing the MP materials belonged to taxa, that are known to degrade polymeric substances, including TM7a, Phenylobacterium, Nocardia, Arthrobacter and Streptomyces. Interestingly, in bulk soil samples amended with MP materials, microbial diversity was higher after 8 weeks compared to the control soil, which was incubated without MP materials. The composition of bacterial communities colonizing the MP materials and bulk soil differed. Mainly Acidobacteria were mostly found in bulk soil, whereas they were rare colonizers of the MP materials. Differences in diversity and community composition between the MP affected bulk soil samples were not found. Overall, our data indicate that MP materials form a new niche for microbes in soil, with a specific community composition depending on the materials used, strongly influencing the bulk soil microbiota in the short term. Long-term consequences for the soil microbiome and associated functions including different soils need to be further elaborated in the future for a proper risk assessment of the mode of action of MP materials in terrestrial ecosystems.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis",,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
369,2022,Microbial mechanism of zinc fertilizer input on rice grain yield and zinc content of polished rice,"Zinc is an essential minor element for rice growth and human health, which can also change the structure of the microorganisms. However, it remains unclear for the effects of zinc fertilizer on microbiome function in agricultural soils and crops. To solve this research gap, we investigated the relationship between improving rice (Oryza sativa L.) yield, Zn concentration, soil microbial community diversity, and function by the application of Zn fertilizer. The field trials included three rice varieties (Huanghuazhan, Nanjing9108, and Nuodao-9925) and two soil Zn levels (0 and 30 kg ha–1) in Jiangsu province, China. As a test, we studied the variety of soil bacterial composition, diversity, and function using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results showed that soil Zn application reduced the diversity of microbial community, but the bacterial network was more closely linked, and the metabolic function of bacterial community was improved, which increased the grain yield (17.34–19.52%) and enriched the Zn content of polished rice (1.40–20.05%). Specifically, redundancy analysis (RDA) and Mantel’s test results revealed soil total nitrogen (TN) was the primary driver that led to a community shift in the rice rhizosphere bacterial community, and soil organic carbon (SOC) was considered to have a strong influence on dominant phyla. Furthermore, network analysis indicated the most critical bacterial taxa were identified as Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Chloroflexi based on their topological roles of microorganisms. KEGG metabolic pathway prediction demonstrated that soil Zn application significantly (p < 0.05) improved lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and xenobiotic biodegradation. Overall, their positive effects were different among rice varieties, of which Nanjing-9108 (NJ9108) performed better. This study opens new avenues to deeply understand the plant and soil–microbe interactions by the application of fertilizer and further navigates the development of Zn-rich rice cultivation strategies.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome",Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
370,2022,Hormetic effect of 17α-ethynylestradiol on activated sludge microbial community response,"Synthetic estrogen analogues are among the most potent estrogenic contaminants in effluents from wastewater treatment plants. Although its effects have been well elucidated in the feminization of male fish and interference with the endocrine systems in humans, it has not been fully explored in the activated sludge (AS) microbiome, particularly EE2 (17α-ethynylestradiol). Therefore, in this study, the bacterial community shift in a 6-day laboratory-scale reactor in environmental (0, 5, 10, and 100 ng/L) and predictive elevated concentrations (5, 10, and 100 mg/L) of EE2 was investigated using culture-based and metagenomics approaches. Results showed significant changes (t-test, all p < 0.05) between initial and final physicochemical parameters (pH, DO, and EC). Although environmental concentrations showed a slight decrease in microbial counts (5.6 × 106 to 4.6 × 106 CFU/ml) after a 24-h incubation for the culturable approach, the predictive elevated concentrations (5 to 100 mg/L) revealed a drastic microbial counts reduction (5.6 × 106 to 8 × 102 CFU/ml). The metagenomic data analysis uncovered that bacterial communities in the control sample were dominated by Proteobacteria, followed by Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. The taxonomic classification after exposure of microbial communities in various concentrations revealed significant differences in community composition between environmental concentration (Shannon indices between 2.58 to 3.68) and predictive elevated concentrations (Shannon indices between 2.24 and 2.84; t-test, all p < 0.05). The EE2 enriched seven OTUs were Novosphingobium, Cloacibacterium, Stenotrophomonas, Enterobacteriaceae_unclassified, Stenotrophomonas, Enterobacteriaceae_unclassified and Rhodobacteraceae_unclassified. These results were supported by a dehydrogenase activity (DHA) test, which demonstrated less (about 40%) DHA in predictive elevated concentrations than in environmental concentrations. Notwithstanding, these findings suggest that EE2 may possess potent hormetic effect as evidenced by promotion of microbiome richness and dehydrogenase activity of AS in lower EE2 doses.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,"(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
371,2022,Designing a synthetic microbial community devoted to biological control: The case study of Fusarium wilt of banana,"Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) tropical race 4 (TR4) is threatening banana production because of its increasing spread. Biological control approaches have been widely studied and constitute interesting complementary measures to integrated disease management strategies. They have been based mainly on the use of single biological control agents (BCAs). In this study, we moved a step forward by designing a synthetic microbial community (SynCom) for the control of Fusarium wilt of banana (FWB). Ninety-six isolates of Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus spp., Streptomyces spp., and Trichoderma spp. were obtained from the banana rhizosphere and selected in vitro for the antagonism against Foc TR4. In pot experiments, a large community such as SynCom 1.0 (44 isolates with moderate to high antagonistic activity) or a small one such as SynCom 1.1 (seven highly effective isolates) provided similar disease control (35% symptom severity reduction). An in vitro study of the interactions among SynCom 1.1 isolates and between them and Foc revealed that beneficial microorganisms not only antagonized the pathogen but also some of the SynCom constituents. Furthermore, Foc defended itself by antagonizing the beneficial microbes. We also demonstrated that fusaric acid, known as one of the secondary metabolites of Fusarium species, might be involved in such an interaction. With this knowledge, SynCom 1.2 was then designed with three isolates: Pseudomonas chlororaphis subsp. piscium PS5, Bacillus velezensis BN8.2, and Trichoderma virens T2C1.4. A non-simultaneous soil application of these isolates (to diminish cross-inhibition) delayed FWB progress over time, with significant reductions in incidence and severity. SynCom 1.2 also performed better than two commercial BCAs, BioPak® and T-Gro. Eventually, SynCom 1.2 isolates were characterized for several biocontrol traits and their genome was sequenced. Our data showed that assembling a SynCom for biocontrol is not an easy task. The mere mixtures of antagonists (e.g., SynCom 1.0 and 1.1) might provide effective biocontrol, but an accurate investigation of the interactions among beneficial microorganisms is needed to improve the results (e.g., SynCom 1.2). SynCom 1.2 is a valuable tool to be further developed for the biological control of FWB.","Microbiome, Pathogen","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, Interactome","(Meta)genomics, Metabolomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
372,2022,Co-Occurrence of β-Lactam and Aminoglycoside Resistance Determinants among Clinical and Environmental Isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli: A Genomic Approach,"The presence of antimicrobial-resistance genes (ARGs) in mobile genetic elements (MGEs) facilitates the rapid development and dissemination of multidrug-resistant bacteria, which represents a serious problem for human health. This is a One Health study which aims to investigate the co-occurrence of antimicrobial resistance determinants among clinical and environmental isolates of K. pneumoniae and E. coli. Various bioinformatics tools were used to elucidate the bacterial strains’ ID, resistome, virulome, MGEs, and phylogeny for 42 isolates obtained from hospitalized patients (n = 20) and environmental sites (including fresh vegetables, fruits, and drinking water) (n = 22). The multilocus sequence typing (MLST) showed that K. pneumoniae belonged to ten sequence types (STs) while the E. coli belonged to seventeen STs. Multidrug-resistant isolates harbored β-lactam, aminoglycoside resistance determinants, and MGE were detected circulating in the environment (drinking water, fresh vegetables, and fruits) and in patients hospitalized with postoperative infections, neonatal sepsis, and urinary tract infection. Four K. pneumoniae environmental isolates (7E, 16EE, 1KE, and 19KE) were multidrug-resistant and were positive for different beta-lactam and aminoglycoside resistance determinants. blaCTX-M-15 in brackets of ISEc 9 and Tn 3 transposases was detected in isolates circulating in the pediatrics unit of Soba hospital and the environment. This study documented the presence of bacterial isolates harboring a similar pattern of antimicrobial resistance determinants circulating in hospitals and environments. A rapid response is needed from stakeholders to initiate a program for infection prevention and control measures to detect such clones disseminated in the communities and hospitals.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR, (M)LST",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
373,2022,Characterization of the Intestinal Fungal Microbiome in HIV and HCV Mono-Infected or Co-Infected Patients,"Intestinal mycobiome dysbiosis plays an important role in the advancement of HIV- and HCV-infected patients. Co-infection with HCV is an important risk factor for exacerbating immune activation in HIV-infected patients, and gut fungal microbial dysbiosis plays an important role. However, no systematic study has been conducted on the intestinal fungal microbiome of HIV/HCV co-infected patients to date. Patients infected with HIV and HCV, either alone or in combination, and healthy volunteers were included. Stool samples were collected for fungal ITS sequencing and for further mycobiome statistical analysis. We found that the abundance of fungal species significantly decreased in the HIV/HCV co-infection group compared to in the healthy control group, while no significant differences were found in the mono-infection groups. Low-CD4 + T-cell patients in the HIV group and high-ALT-level patients in the HCV group were discovered to have a more chaotic fungal community. Furthermore, the opportunistic pathogenic fungal profiles and fungal inter-correlations in the co-infection group became less characteristic but more complicated than those in the mono-infection groups. Intestinal fungal dysregulation occurs in HIV- and HCV-infected patients, and this dysregulation is further complicated in HIV/HCV co-infected patients.","Microbiome, Pathogen",Community (taxonomy) profiling,,Health & Disease
374,2022,MiCloud: A unified web platform for comprehensive microbiome data analysis,"The recent advance in massively parallel sequencing has enabled accurate microbiome profiling at a dramatically lowered cost. Then, the human microbiome has been the subject of intensive investigation in public health and medicine. In the meanwhile, researchers have developed lots of microbiome data analysis methods, protocols, and/or tools. Among those, especially, the web platforms can be highlighted because of the user-friendly interfaces and streamlined protocols for a long sequence of analytic procedures. However, existing web platforms can handle only a categorical trait of interest, cross-sectional study design, and the analysis with no covariate adjustment. We therefore introduce here a unified web platform, named MiCloud, for a binary or continuous trait of interest, cross-sectional or longitudinal/family-based study design, and with or without covariate adjustment. MiCloud handles all such types of analyses for both ecological measures (i.e., alpha and beta diversity indices) and microbial taxa in relative abundance on different taxonomic levels (i.e., phylum, class, order, family, genus and species). Importantly, MiCloud also provides a unified analytic protocol that streamlines data inputs, quality controls, data transformations, statistical methods and visualizations with vastly extended utility and flexibility that are suited to microbiome data analysis. We illustrate the use of MiCloud through the United Kingdom twin study on the association between gut microbiome and body mass index adjusting for age. MiCloud can be implemented on either the web server (http://micloud.kr) or the user’s computer (https://github.com/wg99526/micloudgit).",Microbiome,Community (taxonomy) profiling,,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
375,2022,PCR based fingerprinting techniques to transpire the microbial populations diversity of biofilm based nitrifying packed bed bioreactor in the bioremediation of aquaculture wastewater,"To deal with the increasing risk of pollutants from the aquaculture practice, wastewater treatment systems are considered to be an ideal strategy, for reducing the impact on the natural ecosystem. Biological treatment systems per se bioreactors involving microorganisms are efficient in the bioremediation process is determined by the reactor design, operational module i.e., structure of the bacterial community, and their diversity which in turn reveals the essential relationship between its ecosystem and the environmental factors. Microbial diversity and the dynamics of the microbial populations illustrate the principal background of different bacterial communal development performing bioremediation. Progression in genome exploration led to multifaceted technical ease in recent with the emergence of different generation sequencing technologies e.g., Sanger sequencing, 454 sequencing, Illumina/Solexa sequencing, Single-molecule real-time sequencing, and Oxford nanopore sequencing. Though the recent advancements provide a greater profile of information for research, using high throughput sequencing could not be a suitable option in all aspects, especially in consideration of the initial research requirement, the low number of targets, minimal samples, and also the diversity scaling methodologies. In this review, we have discussed the PCR-based molecular fingerprinting techniques which go accessible with sanger sequencing methodologies as well as by combining different statistical and bioinformatic algorithms. The systematic analysis with the elementary molecular techniques combining sequence technologies and bioinformatics tools would enable us to understand the overview and diversity structure of the biofilm and further in-depth research by selecting appropriate sequencing platforms results in the dynamics of the microbial community.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,(Meta)genomics,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
376,2022,Microbial determinants of effective donors in faecal microbiota transplantation for UC,"Objective Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has variable efficacy in treating UC. Recently, oral lyophilised FMT was found to induce remission in patients with UC, with one donor having 100% efficacy compared with a second donor (36% efficacy). We characterised differences in the gut microbiota of these two donors with the aim of improving FMT donor selection. Design Faecal samples from the two donors were collected over a period of 44 (donor 1) or 70 (donor 2) weeks. The microbiome and metabolome were profiled using shotgun metagenomics and untargeted metabolomics Results Gut microbiome long-term stability was highly evident in the effective donor. Donor microbiota species evenness was a robust feature associated with clinical efficacy across two clinical trials of FMT in UC, leading to increased donor species engraftment in patients. Alpha diversity and beta diversity of donor gut microbiotas significantly differed. 90 bacterial species and one archaeon were differentially abundant between donors, 44 of which were >0.1% in relative abundance. 17/44 species were enriched in the effective donor, 11 of which (64.7%) were assembled into high-quality genomes that were prevalent (≥75% samples) in that donor, and six showed evidence of engraftment in patients. Taxonomic differences between donors translated to substantial microbial functional differences that were validated using metabolomics. Conclusion Donor microbiota stability and species evenness were identified as novel metrics that were associated with therapeutic efficacy in UC, beyond individual microbial species or metabolites. These metrics may represent community resilience that translates to better engraftment in the host.

377,2022,Resistome Analysis of Global Livestock and Soil Microbiomes,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious threat to public health globally; it is estimated that AMR bacteria caused 1.27 million deaths in 2019, and this is set to rise to 10 million deaths annually. Agricultural and soil environments act as antimicrobial resistance gene (ARG) reservoirs, operating as a link between different ecosystems and enabling the mixing and dissemination of resistance genes. Due to the close interactions between humans and agricultural environments, these AMR gene reservoirs are a major risk to both human and animal health. In this study, we aimed to identify the resistance gene reservoirs present in four microbiomes: poultry, ruminant, swine gastrointestinal (GI) tracts coupled with those from soil. This large study brings together every poultry, swine, ruminant, and soil shotgun metagenomic sequence available on the NCBI sequence read archive for the first time. We use the ResFinder database to identify acquired antimicrobial resistance genes in over 5,800 metagenomes. ARGs were diverse and widespread within the metagenomes, with 235, 101, 167, and 182 different resistance genes identified in the poultry, ruminant, swine, and soil microbiomes, respectively. The tetracycline resistance genes were the most widespread in the livestock GI microbiomes, including tet(W)_1, tet(Q)_1, tet(O)_1, and tet(44)_1. The tet(W)_1 resistance gene was found in 99% of livestock GI tract microbiomes, while tet(Q)_1 was identified in 93%, tet(O)_1 in 82%, and finally tet(44)_1 in 69%. Metatranscriptomic analysis confirmed these genes were “real” and expressed in one or more of the livestock GI tract microbiomes, with tet(40)_1 and tet(O)_1 expressed in all three livestock microbiomes. In soil, the most abundant ARG was the oleandomycin resistance gene, ole(B)_1. A total of 55 resistance genes were shared by the four microbiomes, with 11 ARGs actively expressed in two or more microbiomes. By using all available metagenomes we were able to mine a large number of samples and describe resistomes in 37 countries. This study provides a global insight into the diverse and abundant antimicrobial resistance gene reservoirs present in both livestock and soil microbiomes.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Interactome, AMR","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics, (Meta)transcriptomics, Metatranscriptomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
378,2022,"Biomineralization in Cave Bacteria—Popcorn and Soda Straw Crystal Formations, Morphologies, and Potential Metabolic Pathways","Caves are extreme, often oligotrophic, environments that house diverse groups of microorganisms. Many of these microbes can perform microbiologically induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) to form crystalline secondary cave deposits known as speleothems. The urease family is a group of enzymes involved in MICP that catalyze the breakdown of urea, which is a source of energy, into ammonia and carbonate. Carbonate anions are effluxed to the extracellular surface of the bacterium where it then binds to environmental calcium to form calcium carbonate which then continues to grow in crystal form. Here, we studied bacterial communities from speleothems collected from the Iron Curtain Cave (ICC) in Chilliwack, B.C., Canada, to characterize these organisms and determine whether urease-positive (U+) bacteria were present in the cave and their potential impact on speleothem formation. The ICC is a carbonate cave located on the northside of Chipmunk Ridge, presenting a unique environment with high iron content sediment and limestone structures throughout. With six pools of water throughout the cave, the environment is highly humid, with temperatures ranging between 4 and 12°C depending on the time of year. Ninety-nine bacterial strains were isolated from popcorn (PCS) and soda straw (SSS) speleothems. These isolates were screened for urease enzymatic activity, with 11 candidates found to be urease-positive. After incubation, species-specific crystal morphologies were observed. Popcorn speleothem provided more bacterial diversity overall when compared to soda straw speleothem when examined under a culture-based method. Nearly twice as many U+ isolates were isolated from popcorn speleothems compared to soda straw speleothems. The U+ candidates were identified to the genus level by 16S rRNA analysis, and two isolates underwent whole-genome sequencing. Two novel species were identified as Sphingobacterium sp. PCS056 and Pseudarthrobacter sp. SSS035. Both isolates demonstrated the most crystal production as well as the most morphologically dissimilar crystal shapes in broth culture and were found to produce crystals as previously observed in both agar and broth media. The results from this study are consistent with the involvement of urease-positive bacteria isolated from the ICC in the formation of cave speleothems. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed a diverse set of microbes inhabiting the speleothems that have urease activity. Whole-genome sequencing of the two chosen isolates confirmed the presence of urease pathways, while revealing differences in urease pathway structure and number. This research contributes to understanding microbial-associated cave formation and degradation, with applications to cave conservation, microbiota composition, and their role in shaping the cave environment.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
379,2022,A pals-25 gain-of-function allele triggers systemic resistance against natural pathogens of C. elegans,"Regulation of immunity throughout an organism is critical for host defense. Previous studies in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have described an “ON/OFF” immune switch comprised of the antagonistic paralogs PALS-25 and PALS-22, which regulate resistance against intestinal and epidermal pathogens. Here, we identify and characterize a PALS-25 gain-of-function mutant protein with a premature stop (Q293*), which we find is freed from physical repression by its negative regulator, the PALS-22 protein. PALS-25(Q293*) activates two related gene expression programs, the Oomycete Recognition Response (ORR) against natural pathogens of the epidermis, and the Intracellular Pathogen Response (IPR) against natural intracellular pathogens of the intestine. A subset of ORR/IPR genes is upregulated in pals-25(Q293*) mutants, and they are resistant to oomycete infection in the epidermis, and microsporidia and virus infection in the intestine, but without compromising growth. Surprisingly, we find that activation of PALS-25 seems to primarily stimulate the downstream bZIP transcription factor ZIP-1 in the epidermis, which leads to upregulation of gene expression in both the epidermis and in the intestine. Interestingly, we find that this epidermal-to-intestinal signaling promotes resistance to the N. parisii intestinal pathogen, demonstrating cross-tissue protective immune induction from one epithelial tissue to another in C. elegans. Author summary Multicellular organisms need to monitor the health and function of multiple tissues simultaneously to respond appropriately to pathogen infection. Here, we study an ON/OFF switch in the roundworm C. elegans that controls immune responses to diverse natural pathogens of the skin and gut. We show a physical association between the ‘ON switch’ protein PALS-25 and the ‘OFF switch’ protein PALS-22, and that this association is disrupted in a mutant, activated form of PALS-25. When either PALS-22 is lost, or PALS-25 is activated, a downstream immune regulator ZIP-1 is activated specifically in the skin but not the gut. Excitingly, our findings show that skin-specific loss of PALS-22 or skin-specific activation of PALS-25 can induce immune responses in the worm gut. These findings highlight the coordination of immune responses across different tissues that are commonly infected by microbial pathogens.","Virus, Pathogen","Functional analysis, AMR",,Health & Disease
380,2022,Phylotypic Diversity of Bacteria Associated with Speleothems of a Silicate Cave in a Guiana Shield Tepui,"The diversity of microorganisms associated with speleological sources has mainly been studied in limestone caves, while studies in silicate caves are still under development. Here, we profiled the microbial diversity of opal speleothems from a silicate cave in Guiana Highlands. Bulk DNAs were extracted from three speleothems of two types, i.e., one soft whitish mushroom-like speleothem and two hard blackish coral-like speleothems. The extracted DNAs were amplified for sequencing the V3–V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene by MiSeq. A total of 210,309 valid reads were obtained and clustered into 3184 phylotypes or operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The OTUs from the soft whitish speleothem were mostly affiliated with Acidobacteriota, Pseudomonadota (formerly, Proteobacteria), and Chloroflexota, with the OTUs ascribed to Nitrospirota being found specifically in this speleothem. The OTUs from the hard blackish speleothems were similar to each other and were mostly affiliated with Pseudomonadota, Acidobacteriota, and Actinomycetota (formerly, Actinobacteria). These OTU compositions were generally consistent with those reported for limestone and silicate caves. The OTUs were further used to infer metabolic features by using the PICRUSt bioinformatic tool, and membrane transport and amino acid metabolism were noticeably featured. These and other featured metabolisms may influence the pH microenvironment and, consequently, the formation, weathering, and re-deposition of silicate speleothems.",Bacteria,Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

382,2022,Ruminal Bacterial Communities and Metabolome Variation in Beef Heifers Divergent in Feed Efficiency,"This study determined potential microbial and metabolic biomarkers of feed efficiency in Angus heifers. Seventeen ruminal cannulated Angus heifers underwent a 70-day feed efficiency trial. Residual feed intake was used to determine high and low feed efficient heifers. On day 70 of the trial, rumen content and blood were collected and used for microbial and metabolomic analyses, respectively. Bacterial populations were examined by targeting the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene and analyzed using QIIME and SAS. Rumen fluid and serum metabolites were analyzed using MetaboAnalyst. No microbial taxa differed after false discovery rate correction, but seven did differ (p ≤ 0.05) prior to correction, including Lachnospiraceae (Other), Desulfobulbaceae, Neisseriaceae, Shuttleworthia, Corynebacterium, p-75-a5, and L7A-E11. No differences were observed in alpha diversity metrics. Beta diversity utilizing unweighted UniFrac distances analyzed via PERMANOVA was significant (p = 0.03). Several metabolites in rumen fluid metabolites were correlated with bacteria that differed by feed efficiency phenotype. The metabolites correlated with bacteria were primarily involved in nutrient signaling and microbial crude protein availability. These data suggest variation in the availability of nutrients, primarily amino acids, as well as a relationship among microbiota, metabolome, and host feed efficiency phenotypes in heifers.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Gene identification / Biomarker","Metabarcoding, Metabolomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
383,2022,Longitudinal 16S rRNA Sequencing Reveals Relationships among Alterations of Gut Microbiota and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Progression in Mice,"This study concentrates on longitudinal alternations of gut microbiota in NAFLD progression and discovers the interrelationships between them. These findings may uncover the role of gut microbiota in NAFLD progression and identify novel noninvasive diagnostic tools for NAFLD based on microbial biomarkers. ABSTRACT Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent and progressive disease spectrum ranging from nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), yet there is no effective treatment and efficient noninvasive diagnostic method for NASH. The present study investigated the longitudinal alternations of gut microbiota in the Western diet (WD) induced murine NAFLD model using 16S rRNA sequencing. Evident steatosis and inflammation were detected in the liver at the 8th and 12th week, while prompted hepatic oxidative injury and fibrosis were found at the 16th week. In this progressive process, impaired bile acid (BA) metabolism plays a vital part. Long-term WD intervention alters microbial richness and composition in the intestine, shaping characteristic microbial feature correspondence to each NAFLD stage. Descending abundances of Clostridia and Ruminococcaceae were found in NAFLD progression, while inflammation-related microbes [Eubacterium]_fissicatena_group, Romboutsia, and Erysipelatoclostridium were verified to identify borderline NASH at 8th and 12th week, and BA-associated taxa Dubosiella, Bosea, Helicobacter, and Alistipes were recognized as special symbols reflecting the state of oxidative damage and fibrosis in NASH at 16th week. Further, feces and colon abundances of Akkermansia were verified to be depleted in the process of borderline NASH progressed to NASH, and exhibited substantial correlations with NAFLD indexes ALT, AST, TC, and TBA. These characteristic taxa were effective to identify NAFLD and NASH, and microbiota-derived predictive models for NAFLD and NASH exhibited great potential (AUC 0.983 and 0.784). These findings demonstrate that a core set of gut microbiome especially BA-related taxa may be adopted as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for NAFLD and NASH. IMPORTANCE This study concentrates on longitudinal alternations of gut microbiota in NAFLD progression and discovers the interrelationships between them. These findings may uncover the role of gut microbiota in NAFLD progression and identify novel noninvasive diagnostic tools for NAFLD based on microbial biomarkers.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Gene identification / Biomarker,Metabarcoding,Health & Disease
384,2022,"Clinical and Genomic Investigation of an International Ceftriaxone- and Azithromycin-Resistant Shigella sonnei Cluster among Men Who Have Sex with Men, Montréal, Canada 2017–2019","Shigella sonnei, an important foodborne pathogen, recently became a frequent sexually transmitted agent involved in large and persistent outbreaks globally among men who have sex with men. Most strains also harbor several multidrug-resistant (MDR) determinants of particular concern. ABSTRACT Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Shigella sonnei have become prevalent among men who have sex with men and have become a global public health concern. From June 2017 to April 2019, 32 men were infected with MDR S. sonnei acquired locally, in Montréal, which was suggestive of an outbreak. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), phylogenetic analysis, antimicrobial resistance and virulence characterization, and association to international clusters were performed. The outbreak strain was ceftriaxone- and azithromycin-resistant due to the acquisition of blaCTX-M-27, and mphA and ermB genes, respectively, with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin due to a single point mutation (gyrA S83L). One out of 27 patients treated with a fluoroquinolone experienced microbiological failure. Epidemiological evidence first supported by a rare unique MDR Shigella sonnei documented only in men in 2017 followed by similar pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles was confirmed by WGS. A core genome high-quality single-nucleotide variant (hqSNV)-based phylogeny found a median of 6 hqSNV differences among isolates. Virulence gene content was investigated, but no Shiga toxins were detected. An international cluster of highly related isolates was identified (PDS000019750.208) and belonged to the 3.7.29.1.4.1 S. sonnei genotype (Global III VN2.KH1.Aus). Genomic analysis revealed that this Montréal cluster was connected to other documented outbreaks in Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom. This study highlights the urgent need for public health measures to focus on the prevention and the early detection of S. sonnei, since global transmission patterns of MDR strains is concerning and few antimicrobial treatment options are available. IMPORTANCE Shigella sonnei, an important foodborne pathogen, recently became a frequent sexually transmitted agent involved in large and persistent outbreaks globally among men who have sex with men. Most strains also harbor several multidrug-resistant (MDR) determinants of particular concern. This study characterizes an outbreak strain at the source of an important MDR cluster identified in Montréal in 2017. Associations were made to many high-profile international outbreaks, and the causative S. sonnei lineage of these clusters was identified, which was not evident in past reports. The worldwide occurrence of this strain is of concern since treatment with antimicrobials like ceftriaxone and azithromycin may not be effective, and rare microbiological failures have been documented in patients treated with ciprofloxacin. Our investigation highlights the threats of Shigella spp. infection and the necessity for antimicrobial susceptibility monitoring in order to mitigate S. sonnei’s impact on public health and to avoid transmission to other at-risk communities.","Microbiome, Pathogen","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR, Variant",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease
385,2022,Dynamics of Salmonella enterica and antimicrobial resistance in the Brazilian poultry industry and global impacts on public health,"Non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica is a common cause of diarrhoeal disease; in humans, consumption of contaminated poultry meat is believed to be a major source. Brazil is the world’s largest exporter of chicken meat globally, and previous studies have indicated the introduction of Salmonella serovars through imported food products from Brazil. Here we provide an in-depth genomic characterisation and evolutionary analysis to investigate the most prevalent serovars and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Brazilian chickens and assess the impact to public health of products contaminated with S. enterica imported into the United Kingdom from Brazil. To do so, we examine 183 Salmonella genomes from chickens in Brazil and 357 genomes from humans, domestic poultry and imported Brazilian poultry products isolated in the United Kingdom. S. enterica serovars Heidelberg and Minnesota were the most prevalent serovars in Brazil and in meat products imported from Brazil into the UK. We extended our analysis to include 1,259 publicly available Salmonella Heidelberg and Salmonella Minnesota genomes for context. The Brazil genomes form clades distinct from global isolates, with temporal analysis suggesting emergence of these Salmonella Heidelberg and Salmonella Minnesota clades in the early 2000s, around the time of the 2003 introduction of the Enteritidis vaccine in Brazilian poultry. Analysis showed genomes within the Salmonella Heidelberg and Salmonella Minnesota clades shared resistance to sulphonamides, tetracyclines and beta-lactams conferred by sul2, tetA and blaCMY-2 genes, not widely observed in other co-circulating serovars despite similar selection pressures. The sul2 and tetA genes were concomitantly carried on IncC plasmids, whereas blaCMY-2 was either co-located with the sul2 and tetA genes on IncC plasmids or independently on IncI1 plasmids. Long-term surveillance data collected in the UK showed no increase in the incidence of Salmonella Heidelberg or Salmonella Minnesota in human cases of clinical disease in the UK following the increase of these two serovars in Brazilian poultry. In addition, almost all of the small number of UK-derived genomes which cluster with the Brazilian poultry-derived sequences could either be attributed to human cases with a recent history of foreign travel or were from imported Brazilian food products. These findings indicate that even should Salmonella from imported Brazilian poultry products reach UK consumers, they are very unlikely to be causing disease. No evidence of the Brazilian strains of Salmonella Heidelberg or Salmonella Minnesota were observed in UK domestic chickens. These findings suggest that introduction of the Salmonella Enteritidis vaccine, in addition to increasing antimicrobial use, could have resulted in replacement of salmonellae in Brazilian poultry flocks with serovars that are more drug resistant, but less associated with disease in humans in the UK. The plasmids conferring resistance to beta-lactams, sulphonamides and tetracyclines likely conferred a competitive advantage to the Salmonella Minnesota and Salmonella Heidelberg serovars in this setting of high antimicrobial use, but the apparent lack of transfer to other serovars present in the same setting suggests barriers to horizontal gene transfer that could be exploited in intervention strategies to reduce AMR. The insights obtained reinforce the importance of One Health genomic surveillance.",,"Isolate, AMR",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease
386,2022,Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 1 causes impaired anti-microbial immunity and inflammation due to dysregulated immunometabolism,"Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) types 1 and 4 are caused by defective vesicle trafficking. The mechanism for Crohn’s disease-like inflammation, lung fibrosis, and macrophage lipid accumulation in these patients remains enigmatic. The aim of this study is to understand the cellular basis of inflammation in HPS-1. We performed mass cytometry, proteomic and transcriptomic analyses to investigate peripheral blood cells and serum of HPS-1 patients. Using spatial transcriptomics, granuloma-associated signatures in the tissue of an HPS-1 patient with granulomatous colitis were dissected. In vitro studies were conducted to investigate anti-microbial responses of HPS-1 patient macrophages and cell lines. Monocytes of HPS-1 patients exhibit an inflammatory phenotype associated with dysregulated TNF, IL-1α, OSM in serum, and monocyte-derived macrophages. Inflammatory macrophages accumulate in the intestine and granuloma-associated macrophages in HPS-1 show transcriptional signatures suggestive of a lipid storage and metabolic defect. We show that HPS1 deficiency leads to an altered metabolic program and Rab32-dependent amplified mTOR signaling, facilitated by the accumulation of mTOR on lysosomes. This pathogenic mechanism translates into aberrant bacterial clearance, which can be rescued with mTORC1 inhibition. Rab32-mediated mTOR signaling acts as an immuno-metabolic checkpoint, adding to the evidence that defective bioenergetics can drive hampered anti-microbial activity and contribute to inflammation.","Bacteria, Virus, Pathogen",,"(Meta)transcriptomics, (Meta)proteomics",Health & Disease
387,2022,Evaluation of a Conformationally Constrained Indole Carboxamide as a Potential Efflux Pump Inhibitor in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Efflux pumps in Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa provide intrinsic antimicrobial resistance by facilitating the extrusion of a wide range of antimicrobials. Approaches for combating efflux-mediated multidrug resistance involve, in part, developing indirect antimicrobial agents capable of inhibiting efflux, thus rescuing the activity of antimicrobials previously rendered inactive by efflux. Herein, TXA09155 is presented as a novel efflux pump inhibitor (EPI) formed by conformationally constraining our previously reported EPI TXA01182. TXA09155 demonstrates strong potentiation in combination with multiple antibiotics with efflux liabilities against wild-type and multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa. At 6.25 µg/mL, TXA09155, showed ≥8-fold potentiation of levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, doxycycline, minocycline, cefpirome, chloramphenicol, and cotrimoxazole. Several biophysical and genetic studies rule out membrane disruption and support efflux inhibition as the mechanism of action (MOA) of TXA09155. TXA09155 was determined to lower the frequency of resistance (FoR) to levofloxacin and enhance the killing kinetics of moxifloxacin. Most importantly, TXA09155 outperformed the levofloxacin-potentiation activity of EPIs TXA01182 and MC-04,124 against a CDC/FDA panel of MDR clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa. TXA09155 possesses favorable physiochemical and ADME properties that warrant its optimization and further development.",Bacteria,"Isolate, AMR",,Health & Disease
388,2022,Niche Partitioning of Labyrinthulomycete Protists Across Sharp Coastal Gradients and Their Putative Relationships With Bacteria and Fungi,"While planktonic microbes play key roles in the coastal oceans, our understanding of heterotrophic microeukaryotes’ ecology, particularly their spatiotemporal patterns, drivers, and functions, remains incomplete. In this study, we focus on a ubiquitous marine fungus-like protistan group, the Labyrinthulomycetes, whose biomass can exceed that of bacterioplankton in coastal oceans but whose ecology is largely unknown. Using quantitative PCR and amplicon sequencing of their 18S rRNA genes, we examine their community variation in repeated five-station transects across the nearshore-to-offshore surface waters of North Carolina, United States. Their total 18S rRNA gene abundance and phylotype richness decrease significantly from the resource-rich nearshore to the oligotrophic offshore waters, but their Pielou’s community evenness appears to increase offshore. Similar to the bacteria and fungi, the Labyrinthulomycete communities are significantly structured by distance from shore, water temperature, and other environmental factors, suggesting potential niche partitioning. Nevertheless, only several Labyrinthulomycete phylotypes, which belong to aplanochytrids, thraustochytrids, or unclassified Labyrinthulomycetes, are prevalent and correlated with cohesive bacterial communities, while more phylotypes are patchy and often co-occur with fungi. Overall, these results complement previous time-series observations that resolve the Labyrinthulomycetes as persistent and short-blooming ecotypes with distinct seasonal preferences, further revealing their partitioning spatial patterns and multifaceted roles in coastal marine microbial food webs.","Bacteria, Eukaryote, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis",Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
389,2022,Harnessing Rare Actinomycete Interactions and Intrinsic Antimicrobial Resistance Enables Discovery of an Unusual Metabolic Inhibitor,"Many antibiotics were originally discovered from microbes. However, in recent decades, resistance to current treatments has risen, while novel antibiotic discovery has become increasingly challenging. ABSTRACT Bacterial natural products have historically been a deep source of new medicines, but their slowed discovery in recent decades has put a premium on developing strategies that enhance the likelihood of capturing novel compounds. Here, we used a straightforward approach that capitalizes on the interactive ecology of “rare” actinomycetes. Specifically, we screened for interactions that triggered the production of antimicrobials that inhibited the growth of a bacterial strain with exceptionally diverse natural antimicrobial resistance. This strategy led to the discovery of a family of antimicrobials we term the dynaplanins. Heterologous expression enabled identification of the dynaplanin biosynthetic gene cluster, which was missed by typical algorithms for natural product gene cluster detection. Genome sequencing of partially resistant mutants revealed a 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase E2 subunit as the likely molecular target of the dynaplanins, and this finding was supported by computational modeling of the dynaplanin scaffold within the active site of this enzyme. Thus, this simple strategy, which leverages microbial interactions and natural antibiotic resistance, can enable discovery of molecules with unique antimicrobial activity. In addition, these results indicate that primary metabolism may be a direct target for inhibition via chemical interference in competitive microbial interactions. IMPORTANCE Many antibiotics were originally discovered from microbes. However, in recent decades, resistance to current treatments has risen, while novel antibiotic discovery has become increasingly challenging. Thus, there is a need to develop new strategies to find novel antimicrobials. Here, we incorporated three levels of innovation into a single, simple discovery pipeline: focusing on understudied bacteria with a high potential for producing antibiotics, growing these bacteria in binary microbial interactions, and screening for activity against a multidrug-resistant bacterium. This led us to discover a family of antimicrobials that we call the dynaplanins, which are synthesized by genes that were not detected by typical prediction algorithms. We found that dynaplanins likely block the function of one of three related enzymes called 2-oxo acid dehydrogenases, which are vital to cellular metabolism. Overall, our strategy based on bacterial competition led to discovery of a novel antibiotic that inhibits the ability to metabolize nutrients.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome, AMR",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
390,2022,Absence of increased genomic variants in the cyanobacterium Chroococcidiopsis exposed to Mars-like conditions outside the space station,"Despite the increasing interest in using microbial-based technologies to support human space exploration, many unknowns remain not only on bioprocesses but also on microbial survivability and genetic stability under non-Earth conditions. Here the desert cyanobacterium Chroococcidiopsis sp. CCMEE 029 was investigated for robustness of the repair capability of DNA lesions accumulated under Mars-like conditions (UV radiation and atmosphere) simulated in low Earth orbit using the EXPOSE-R2 facility installed outside the International Space Station. Genomic alterations were determined in a space-derivate of Chroococcidiopsis sp. CCMEE 029 obtained upon reactivation on Earth of the space-exposed cells. Comparative analysis of whole-genome sequences showed no increased variant numbers in the space-derivate compared to triplicates of the reference strain maintained on the ground. This result advanced cyanobacteria-based technologies to support human space exploration.",Bacteria,"Variant, Comparative analysis",(Meta)genomics,
391,2022,Microbiomes and Planctomycete diversity in large-scale aquaria habitats,"In commercial large-scale aquaria, controlling levels of nitrogenous compounds is essential for macrofauna health. Naturally occurring bacteria are capable of transforming toxic nitrogen species into their more benign counterparts and play important roles in maintaining aquaria health. Nitrification, the microbially-mediated transformation of ammonium and nitrite to nitrate, is a common and encouraged process for management of both commercial and home aquaria. A potentially competing microbial process that transforms ammonium and nitrite to dinitrogen gas (anaerobic ammonium oxidation [anammox]) is mediated by some bacteria within the phylum Planctomycetes. Anammox has been harnessed for nitrogen removal during wastewater treatment, as the nitrogenous end product is released into the atmosphere rather than in aqueous discharge. Whether anammox bacteria could be similarly utilized in commercial aquaria is an open question. As a first step in assessing the viability of this practice, we (i) characterized microbial communities from water and sand filtration systems for four habitats at the Tennessee Aquarium and (ii) examined the abundance and anammox potential of Planctomycetes using culture-independent approaches. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed distinct, yet stable, microbial communities and the presence of Planctomycetes (~1–15% of library reads) in all sampled habitats. Preliminary metagenomic analyses identified the genetic potential for multiple complete nitrogen metabolism pathways. However, no known genes diagnostic for the anammox reaction were found in this survey. To better understand the diversity of this group of bacteria in these systems, a targeted Planctomycete-specific 16S rRNA gene-based PCR approach was used. This effort recovered amplicons that share <95% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity to previously characterized Planctomycetes, suggesting novel strains within this phylum reside within aquaria.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,"Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
392,2022,Enabling genomic island prediction and comparison in multiple genomes to investigate bacterial evolution and outbreaks,"Outbreaks of virulent and/or drug-resistant bacteria have a significant impact on human health and major economic consequences. Genomic islands (GIs; defined as clusters of genes of probable horizontal origin) are of high interest because they disproportionately encode virulence factors, some antimicrobial-resistance (AMR) genes, and other adaptations of medical or environmental interest. While microbial genome sequencing has become rapid and inexpensive, current computational methods for GI analysis are not amenable for rapid, accurate, user-friendly and scalable comparative analysis of sets of related genomes. To help fill this gap, we have developed IslandCompare, an open-source computational pipeline for GI prediction and comparison across several to hundreds of bacterial genomes. A dynamic and interactive visualization strategy displays a bacterial core-genome phylogeny, with bacterial genomes linearly displayed at the phylogenetic tree leaves. Genomes are overlaid with GI predictions and AMR determinants from the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD), and regions of similarity between the genomes are also displayed. GI predictions are performed using Sigi-HMM and IslandPath-DIMOB, the two most precise GI prediction tools based on nucleotide composition biases, as well as a novel blast-based consistency step to improve cross-genome prediction consistency. GIs across genomes sharing sequence similarity are grouped into clusters, further aiding comparative analysis and visualization of acquisition and loss of mobile GIs in specific sub-clades. IslandCompare is an open-source software that is containerized for local use, plus available via a user-friendly, web-based interface to allow direct use by bioinformaticians, biologists and clinicians (at https://islandcompare.ca).",Bacteria,"AMR, Comparative analysis",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
393,2022,Optimisation and Application of a Novel Method to Identify Bacteriophages in Maternal Milk and Infant Stool Identifies Host-Phage Communities Within Preterm Infant Gut,"Human milk oligosaccharides, proteins, such as lactoferrin, and bacteria represent just some of the bioactive components of mother's breast milk (BM). Bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) are an often-overlooked component of BM that can cause major changes in microbial composition and metabolism. BM bacteriophage composition has been explored in term and healthy infants, suggesting vertical transmission of bacteriophages occurs between mothers and their infants. Several important differences between term and very preterm infants (<30 weeks gestational age) may limit this phenomenon in the latter. To better understand the link between BM bacteriophages and gut microbiomes of very preterm infants in health and disease, standardised protocols are required for isolation and characterisation from BM. In this study, we use isolated nucleic acid content, bacteriophage richness and Shannon diversity to validate several parameters applicable during bacteriophage isolation from precious BM samples. Parameters validated include sample volume required; centrifugal sedimentation of microbes; hydrolysis of milk samples with digestive enzymes; induction of temperate bacteriophages and concentration/purification of isolated bacteriophage particles in donor milk (DM). Our optimised method enables characterisation of bacteriophages from as little as 0.1 mL BM. We identify viral families that were exclusively identified with the inclusion of induction of temperate bacteriophages (Inoviridae) and hydrolysis of milk lipid processes (Iridoviridae and Baculoviridae). Once applied to a small clinical cohort we demonstrate the vertical transmission of bacteriophages from mothers BM to the gut of very preterm infants at the species level. This optimised method will enable future research characterising the bacteriophage composition of BM in very preterm infants to determine their clinical relevance in the development of a healthy preterm infant gut microbiome.","Bacteria, Virus, Microbiome","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling",,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
394,2022,Mutations in SilS and CusS/OmpC represent different routes to achieve high level silver ion tolerance in Klebsiella pneumoniae,"Background Silver ions have potent broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and are widely incorporated into a variety of products to limit bacterial growth. In Enterobacteriaceae, decreased silver susceptibility has been mapped to two homologous operons; the chromosomally located cus operon and the plasmid based sil operon. Here we characterised the mechanisms and clinical impact of induced silver tolerance in Klebsiella pneumoniae . Results In K. pneumoniae carriage of the sil operon alone does not give elevated silver tolerance. However, when exposed to increasing concentrations of silver nitrate (AgNO 3 ), K. pneumoniae strains which contain the sil operon, will preferentially mutate SilS, resulting in overexpression of the genes encoding the RND efflux pump silCBA . Those strains which do not carry the sil operon also adapt upon exposure to increasing silver concentrations through mutations in another two-component regulator CusS. Secondary mutations leading to disruption of the outer membrane porin OmpC were also detected. Both routes result in a high level of silver tolerance with MIC’s of >512 mg/L. When exposed to a high concentration of AgNO 3 (400 mg/L), only strains that contained the sil operon were able to survive, again through mutations in SilS. The AgNO 3 adapted strains were also resistant to killing by challenge with several clinical and commercial silver containing dressings. Conclusions This study shows that K. pneumoniae has two possible pathways for development of increased silver tolerance but that the sil operon is preferentially mutated. This operon is essential when K. pneumoniae is exposed to high concentrations of silver. The potential clinical impact on wound management is shown by the increased survivability of these adapted strains when exposed to several silver impregnated dressings. This would make infections with these strains more difficult to treat and further limits our therapeutic options.",Bacteria,AMR,,Health & Disease
395,2022,Microbiome and related structural features of Earth’s most archaic plant indicate early plant symbiosis attributes,"Origin of earliest land plants from ancestral algae dramatically accelerated the evolution of Earth’s terrestrial ecosystems, in which microbial symbioses have played key roles. Recent molecular diversification analyses identify the rare, geographically-limited moss Takakia as Earth’s most archaic modern land plant. Despite occupying a phylogenetic position pivotal for understanding earliest plants, Takakia microbial associations are poorly known. Here, we describe symbiosis-related structural features and contig-based metagenomic data that illuminate the evolutionary transition from streptophyte algae to early embryophytes. We observed that T. lepidozioides shares with streptophyte algae secretion of microbe-harboring mucilage and bacterial taxa such as Rhizobium and genes indicating nitrogen fixation. We find that Takakia root-analogs produce lateral mucilage organs that are more complex than generally understood, having structural analogies to angiosperm lateral roots adapted for N-fixation symbioses, including presence of intracellular microbes. We also find structural and metagenomic evidence for mycorrhiza-like species of glomalean fungi (including Rhizophagus irregularis) not previously known for mosses, as well as ascomycete fungi (e.g. Rhizoscyphus ericae) that associate with other early-diverging plants. Because Takakia is the oldest known modern plant genus, this study of plants of a remote locale not strongly influenced by human activities may indicate microbiome features of early land plants.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,"(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
396,2022,"Microbiota of the Pregnant Mouse: Characterization of the Bacterial Communities in the Oral Cavity, Lung, Intestine, and Vagina through Culture and DNA Sequencing","Mice are widely utilized as animal models of obstetrical complications; however, the characterization of the murine microbiota during pregnancy has been neglected. Microorganisms from the vagina, oral cavity, intestine, and lung have been found in the intra-amniotic space, where their presence threatens the progression of gestation. ABSTRACT Mice are frequently used as animal models for mechanistic studies of infection and obstetrical disease, yet characterization of the murine microbiota during pregnancy is lacking. The objective of this study was to characterize the microbiotas of distinct body sites of the pregnant mouse—vagina, oral cavity, intestine, and lung—that harbor microorganisms that could potentially invade the murine amniotic cavity, thus leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes. The microbiotas of these body sites were characterized through anoxic, hypoxic, and oxic culture as well as through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. With the exception of the vagina, the cultured microbiotas of each body site varied by atmosphere, with the greatest diversity in the cultured microbiota appearing under anoxic conditions. Only cultures of the vagina were comprehensively representative of the microbiota observed through direct DNA sequencing of body site samples, primarily due to the predominance of two Rodentibacter strains. Identified as Rodentibacter pneumotropicus and Rodentibacter heylii, these isolates exhibited predominance patterns similar to those of Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus iners in the human vagina. Whole-genome sequencing of these Rodentibacter strains revealed shared genomic features, including the ability to degrade glycogen, an abundant polysaccharide in the vagina. In summary, we report body site-specific microbiotas in the pregnant mouse with potential ecological parallels to those of humans. Importantly, our findings indicate that the vaginal microbiotas of pregnant mice can be readily cultured, suggesting that mock vaginal microbiotas can be tractably generated and maintained for experimental manipulation in future mechanistic studies of host vaginal-microbiome interactions. IMPORTANCE Mice are widely utilized as animal models of obstetrical complications; however, the characterization of the murine microbiota during pregnancy has been neglected. Microorganisms from the vagina, oral cavity, intestine, and lung have been found in the intra-amniotic space, where their presence threatens the progression of gestation. Here, we characterized the microbiotas of pregnant mice and established the appropriateness of culture in capturing the microbiota at each site. The high relative abundance of Rodentibacter observed in the vagina is similar to that of Lactobacillus in humans, suggesting potential ecological parallels. Importantly, we report that the vaginal microbiota of the pregnant mouse can be readily cultured under hypoxic conditions, demonstrating that mock microbial communities can be utilized to test the potential ecological parallels between microbiotas in human and murine pregnancy and to evaluate the relevance of the structure of these microbiotas for adverse pregnancy outcomes, especially intra-amniotic infection and preterm birth.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, Interactome","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

398,2022,Tissue-specific transcriptome responses to Fusarium head blight and Fusarium root rot,"Fusarium head blight (FHB) and Fusarium root rot (FRR) are important diseases of small-grained cereals caused by Fusarium species. While host response to FHB has been subject to extensive study, very little is known about response to FRR and the transcriptome responses of FHB and FRR have not been thoroughly compared. Brachypodium distachyon (Bd) is an effective model for investigating host responses to both FHB and FRR. In this study the transcriptome response of Bd to F. graminearum (Fg) infection of heads and roots was investigated. An RNA-seq analysis was performed on both Bd FHB and FRR during the early infection. Additionally, an RNA-seq analysis was performed on in vitro samples of Fg for comparison with Fg gene expression in planta. Differential gene expression and gene-list enrichment analyses were used to compare FHB and FRR transcriptome responses in both Bd and Fg. Differential expression of selected genes was confirmed using RT-qPCR. Most genes associated with receptor signalling, cell-wall modification, oxidative stress metabolism, and cytokinin and auxin biosynthesis and signalling genes were generally upregulated in FHB or were downregulated in FRR. In contrast, Bd genes involved in jasmonic acid and ethylene biosynthesis and signalling, and antimicrobial production were similarly differentially expressed in both tissues in response to infection. A transcriptome analysis of predicted Fg effectors with the same infected material revealed elevated expression of both core tissue- independent genes including cell-wall degradation enzymes and the gene cluster for DON production but also several tissue-dependent genes including those for aurofusarin production and cutin degradation. This evidence suggests that Fg modulates its transcriptome to different tissues of the same host.",,AMR,(Meta)transcriptomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

The present study examined the archaeal diversity and predicted metabolic pathways in two discrete sites (SITE1 and SITE2) contaminated with explosives (RDX and HMX) by amplicon-targeted sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. In total, 14 soil samples were processed, and 35,758 OTUs were observed, among which 981 OTUs were classified as Archaea, representing ~2.7% of the total microbial diversity in our samples. The majority of OTUs belonged to phyla Euryarchaeota (~49%), Crenarchaeota (~24%), and Thaumarchaeota (~23%), while the remaining (~4%) OTUs were affiliated to Candidatus Parvarchaeota, Candidatus Aenigmarchaeota, and Candidatus Diapherotrites. The comparative studies between explosives contaminated and agricultural soil samples (with no history of explosives contamination) displayed significant differences between the compositions of the archaeal communities. Further, the metabolic pathways pertaining to xenobiotic degradation were presumably more abundant in the contaminated sites. Our data provide a first comprehensive report of archaeal communities in explosives contaminated sites and their putative degradation role in such ecosystems which have been as yet unexplored.","Bacteria, Archaea, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Comparative analysis",Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
400,2022,Microbial Diversity and Contribution to the Formation of Volatile Compounds during Fine-Flavor Cacao Bean Fermentation,"Cacao demand is continuously increasing, and variations in cacao prices have been associated with the aroma of fermented cacao beans. However, the role of microorganisms in the formation of volatile-aroma compounds during fermentation remains unclear. Microbial diversity in Nacional × Trinitario cacao was characterized during spontaneous fermentation by using culture-based methods and next-generation sequencing (NGS) of DNA amplicons. Cacao beans that were spontaneously fermented for 0, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h were UV-sterilized prior to the inoculation of the microbial isolates obtained by the culture-based methods. The volatile formation in inoculated cacao beans was evaluated by GC-MS. The species isolated during fermentation included yeast, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida metapsilosis; lactic acid bacteria (LAB), such as Limosilactobacillus fermentum and Liquorilactobacillus nagelii; acetic acid bacteria (AAB), such as Acetobacter pasteurianus, Acetobacter ghanensis and Acetobacter syzygii, as well as other species, such as Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. Additionally, NGS revealed an abundance of environmental microorganisms, including Escherichia spp., Pantoea spp., Staphylococcus spp., Botrytis spp., Tetrapisispora spp. and Pichia spp., among others. During the lab-scale fermentation, the inoculation of S. cerevisiae mostly yielded alcohols, while LAB and AAB produced volatiles associated with floral, almond and fruity notes throughout the fermentation, but AAB also produced acetic acid with a sour aroma. Similarly, the inoculation of C. metapsilosis and Bacillus spp. in 96 h fermented cacao beans yielded esters with floral aromas.

To assess the hypothesis that Candida rugosa lipase (CRL), which has been shown to enhance gut microbiome and metabolite composition, can rebalance the gut microbiome composition and reduce AD pathology, the treatment effects in APPswe/PS1de9 (APP/PS1) mice were investigated. The analysis revealed an increased abundance of Acetatifactor and Clostridiales vadin BB60 genera in the gut; increased lipid hydrolysis in the gut lumen, normalization of peripheral unsaturated fatty acids, and reduction of neuroinflammation and memory deficits post treatment. Finally, we demonstrated that the evoked benefits on memory could be transferred via fecal matter transplant (FMT) into antibiotic-induced microbiome-depleted (AIMD) wildtype mice, ameliorating their memory deficits.

In this work, the aim was to isolate AMP-producing ruminal streptococci and to characterize their genetic features through whole-genome sequencing. We cultured 463 bacterial isolates from the rumen of Nelore bulls, 81 of which were phenotypically classified as being Streptococcaceae. Five isolates with broad-range activity were genome sequenced and confirmed as being Streptococcus lutetiensis. The genetic features linked to their antimicrobial activity or adaptation to the rumen environment were characterized through comparative genomics. The genome of S. lutetiensis UFV80 harbored a putative CRISPR-Cas9 system (Type IIA). Computational tools were used to discover novel biosynthetic clusters linked to the production of bacteriocins. All bacterial genomes harbored genetic clusters related to the biosynthesis of class I and class II bacteriocins. SDS-PAGE confirmed the results obtained in silico and demonstrated that the class II bacteriocins predicted in the genomes of three S. lutetiensis strains had identical molecular mass (5197 Da). These results demonstrate that ruminal bacteria of the Streptococcus bovis/equinus complex represent a promising source of novel antimicrobial peptides.","Bacteria, Pathogen","Isolate, AMR, Comparative analysis",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
404,2022,Spatial Metagenomic Analysis in Understanding the Microbial Diversity of Thar Desert,"Simple Summary We present a systematic investigation of the distribution of microbial communities in arid and semi-arid regions of Thar Desert Rajasthan, India. Their responses in multiple environmental stresses, including surface soil, surface water and underground water were evaluated. We further assess the biotechnological potential of native microorganisms and discover functional species with results providing a detailed understanding of the abundance of microbial communities in these regions, associated with various stress-related biogeochemical and biotechnological processes. We hope our work will facilitate the development of effective future strategies for the use of extremophiles in complex environments. Abstract The arid and semi-arid regions of Rajasthan are one of the most extreme biomes of India, possessing diverse microbial communities that exhibit immense biotechnological potential for industries. Herein, we sampled study sites from arid and semi-arid regions of Thar Desert, Rajasthan, India and subjected them to chemical, physical and metagenomics analysis. The microbial diversity was studied using V3–V4 amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA gene by Illumina MiSeq. Our metagenomic analyses revealed that the sampled sites consist mainly of Proteobacteria (19–31%) followed by unclassified bacteria (5–21%), Actinobacteria (3–25%), Planctomycetes (5–13%), Chloroflexi (2–14%), Bacteroidetes (3–12%), Firmicutes (3–7%), Acidobacteria (1–4%) and Patescibacteria (1–4%). We have found Proteobacteria in abundance which is associated with a range of activities involved in biogeochemical cycles such as carbon, nitrogen, and sulphur. Our study is perhaps the first of its kind to explore soil bacteria from arid and semi-arid regions of Rajasthan, India. We believe that the new microbial candidates found can be further explored for various industrial and biotechnological applications.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
405,2022,Contribution of the efflux pump AcrAB-TolC to the tolerance of chlorhexidine and other biocides in Klebsiella spp.,"Introduction. We are becoming increasingly reliant on the effectiveness of biocides to combat the spread of Gram-negative multi-drug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, including Klebsiella pneumoniae . It has been shown that chlorhexidine exposure can lead to mutations in the efflux pump repressor regulators SmvR and RamR, but the contribution of each individual efflux pump to biocide tolerance is unknown. Hypothesis. Multiple efflux pumps, including SmvA and AcrAB-TolC, are involved in increased tolerance to biocides. However, strains with upregulated AcrAB-TolC caused by biocide exposure are more problematic due to their increased MDR phenotype. Aim. To investigate the role of AcrAB-TolC in the tolerance to several biocides, including chlorhexidine, and the potential threat of cross-resistance to antibiotics through increased expression of this efflux pump. Methodology. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on K. pneumoniae isolates with ramR mutations selected for after exposure to chlorhexidine, as well as transposon mutants in components and regulators of AcrAB-TolC. RTPCR was used to detect the expression levels of this pump after biocide exposure. Strains from the globally important ST258 clade were compared for genetic differences in acrAB-TolC and its regulators and for phenotypic differences in antimicrobial susceptibility. Results. Cross-resistance to antimicrobials was observed following mutations in ramR. Exposure to chlorhexidine led to increased expression of acrA and its activator ramA, and transposon mutants in AcrAB-TolC have increased susceptibility to several biocides, including chlorhexidine. Variations in ramR within the ST258 clade led to an increase in tolerance to certain biocides, although this was strain dependent. One strain, MKP103, that had increased levels of biocide tolerance showed a unique mutation in ramR that was reflected in enhanced expression of acrA and ramA. MKP103 transposon variants were able to further enhance their tolerance to specific biocides with mutations affecting SmvA. Conclusions. Biocide tolerance in K. pneumoniae is dependent upon several components, with increased efflux through AcrAB-TolC being an important one.",Pathogen,"Isolate, AMR, Variant",,Health & Disease
406,2022,Early life microbial exposures shape the Crassostrea gigas immune system for lifelong and intergenerational disease protection,"The interaction of organisms with their surrounding microbial communities influences many biological processes, a notable example of which is the shaping of the immune system in early life. In the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, the role of the environmental microbial community on immune system maturation — and, importantly, protection from infectious disease — is still an open question. Here, we demonstrate that early life microbial exposure durably improves oyster survival when challenged with the pathogen causing Pacific oyster mortality syndrome (POMS), both in the exposed generation and in the subsequent one. Combining microbiota, transcriptomic, genetic, and epigenetic analyses, we show that the microbial exposure induced changes in epigenetic marks and a reprogramming of immune gene expression leading to long-term and intergenerational immune protection against POMS. We anticipate that this protection likely extends to additional pathogens and may prove to be an important new strategy for safeguarding oyster aquaculture efforts from infectious disease. tag the videobyte/videoabstract in this section 5X1-nepGVFkCxreirqFTHA Video Abstract Video Abstract","Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Interactome",(Meta)transcriptomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
407,2022,Timing of antimicrobial prophylaxis for cesarean section is critical for gut microbiome development in term born infants,"ABSTRACT Animal models imply that the perinatal exposure to antibiotics has a substantial impact on microbiome establishment of the offspring. We aimed to evaluate the effect of timing of antimicrobial prophylaxis for cesarean section before versus after cord clamping on gut microbiome composition of term born infants. We performed an exploratory, single center randomized controlled clinical trial. We included forty pregnant women with elective cesarean section at term. The intervention group received single dose intravenous cefuroxime after cord clamping (n = 19), the control group single dose intravenous cefuroxime 30 minutes before skin incision (n = 21). The primary endpoint was microbiome signature of infants and metabolic prediction in the first days of life as determined in meconium samples by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Secondary endpoints were microbiome composition at one month and 1 year of life. In meconium samples of the intervention group, the genus Staphylococcus pre-dominated. In the control group, the placental cross-over of cefuroxime was confirmed in cord blood. A higher amino acid and nitrogen metabolism as well as increased abundance of the genera Cutibacterium, Corynebacterium and Streptophyta were noted (indicator families: Cytophagaceae, Lactobacilaceae, Oxalobacteraceae). Predictive models of metabolic function revealed higher 2ʹfucosyllactose utilization in control group samples. In the follow-up visits, a higher abundance of the genus Clostridium was evident in the intervention group. Our exploratory randomized controlled trial suggests that timing of antimicrobial prophylaxis is critical for early microbiome engraftment but not antimicrobial resistance emergence in term born infants.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Functional analysis, AMR",Metabarcoding,Health & Disease

409,2022,Small investments with big returns: environmental genomic bioprospecting of microbial life,"Abstract Microorganisms and their natural products are major drivers of ecological processes and industrial applications. Microbial bioprospecting has been critical for the advancement in various fields such as pharmaceuticals, sustainable industries, food security and bioremediation. Next generation sequencing has been paramount in the exploration of diverse environmental microbiomes. It presents a culture-independent approach to investigating hitherto uncultured taxa, resulting in the creation of massive sequence databases, which are available in the public domain. Genome mining searches available (meta)genomic data for target biosynthetic genes, and combined with the large-scale public data, this in-silico bioprospecting method presents an efficient and extensive way to uncover microbial bioproducts. Bioinformatic tools have progressed to a stage where we can recover genomes from the environment; these metagenome-assembled genomes present a way to understand the metabolic capacity of microorganisms in a physiological and ecological context. Environmental sampling been extensive across various ecological settings, including microbiomes with unique physicochemical properties that could influence the discovery of novel functions and metabolic pathways. Although in-silico methods cannot completely substitute in-vitro studies, the contextual information it provides is invaluable for understanding the ecological and taxonomic distribution of microbial genotypes and to form effective strategies for future microbial bioprospecting efforts.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, MAGs","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
410,2022,Directed Evolution of Replication-Competent Double-Stranded DNA Bacteriophage toward New Host Specificity.,"In the fight against antimicrobial resistance, bacteriophages are a promising alternative to antibiotics. However, due to their narrow spectra, phage therapy requires the careful matching between the host and bacteriophage to be effective. Despite our best efforts, nature remains as the only source of novel phage specificity. Directed evolution can potentially open an avenue for engineering phage specificity and improving qualities of phages that are not strongly selected for in their natural environments but are important for therapeutic applications. In this work, we present a strategy that generates large libraries of replication-competent phage variants directly from synthetic DNA fragments, with no restriction on their host specificity. Using the T7 bacteriophage as a proof-of-concept, we created a large library of tail fiber mutants with at least 107 unique variants. From this library, we identified mutants that have broadened specificity as evidenced by their novel lytic activity against Yersinia enterocolitica, a strain that the wild-type T7 was unable to lyse. Using the same concept, mutants with improved lytic efficiency and characteristics, such as lytic condition tolerance and resistance suppression, were also identified. However, the observed limitations in altering host specificity by tail fiber mutagenesis suggest that other bottlenecks could be of equal or even greater importance.","Bacteria, Virus","AMR, Variant",,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
411,2022,Human Beta Defensin 2 Ameliorated Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease in Mice,"Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a prevalent liver disorder and significant global healthcare burden with limited effective therapeutic options. The gut-liver axis is a critical factor contributing to susceptibility to liver injury due to alcohol consumption. In the current study, we tested whether human beta defensin-2 (hBD-2), a small anti-microbial peptide, attenuates experimental chronic ALD. Male C57Bl/6J mice were fed an ethanol (EtOH)-containing diet for 6 weeks with daily administration of hBD-2 (1.2 mg/kg) by oral gavage during the final week. Two independent cohorts of mice with distinct baseline gut microbiota were used. Oral hBD-2 administration attenuated liver injury in both cohorts as determined by decreased plasma ALT activity. Notably, the degree of hBD-2-mediated reduction of EtOH-associated liver steatosis, hepatocellular death, and inflammation was different between cohorts, suggesting microbiota-specific mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of hBD-2. Indeed, we observed differential mechanisms of hBD-2 between cohorts, which included an induction of hepatic and small intestinal IL-17A and IL-22, as well as an increase in T regulatory cell abundance in the gut and mesenteric lymph nodes. Lastly, hBD-2 modulated the gut microbiota composition in EtOH-fed mice in both cohorts, with significant decreases in multiple genera including Barnesiella, Parabacteroides, Akkermansia, and Alistipes, as well as altered abundance of several bacteria within the family Ruminococcaceae. Collectively, our results demonstrated a protective effect of hBD-2 in experimental ALD associated with immunomodulation and microbiota alteration. These data suggest that while the beneficial effects of hBD-2 on liver injury are uniform, the specific mechanisms of action are associated with baseline microbiota.","Bacteria, Microbiome",,,Health & Disease
412,2022,Transcriptomics and Functional Analysis of Copper Stress Response in the Sulfate-Reducing Bacterium Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20,"Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient required as a co-factor in the catalytic center of many enzymes. However, excess Cu can generate pleiotropic effects in the microbial cell. In addition, leaching of Cu from pipelines results in elevated Cu concentration in the environment, which is of public health concern. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) have been demonstrated to grow in toxic levels of Cu. However, reports on Cu toxicity towards SRB have primarily focused on the degree of toxicity and subsequent elimination. Here, Cu(II) stress-related effects on a model SRB, Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20, is reported. Cu(II) stress effects were assessed as alterations in the transcriptome through RNA-Seq at varying Cu(II) concentrations (5 µM and 15 µM). In the pairwise comparison of control vs. 5 µM Cu(II), 61.43% of genes were downregulated, and 38.57% were upregulated. In control vs. 15 µM Cu(II), 49.51% of genes were downregulated, and 50.5% were upregulated. The results indicated that the expression of inorganic ion transporters and translation machinery was massively modulated. Moreover, changes in the expression of critical biological processes such as DNA transcription and signal transduction were observed at high Cu(II) concentrations. These results will help us better understand the Cu(II) stress-response mechanism and provide avenues for future research.",Bacteria,Functional analysis,(Meta)transcriptomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

414,2021,Gut mucus layer degradation is associated with aggressive cervical cancer phenotype,"
 Background

Gut microbiome community composition differs between cervical cancer (CC) patients and healthy controls, and increased gut diversity is associated with improved outcomes after treatment. We proposed that functions of specific microbial species adjoining the mucus layer may directly impact the biology of CC.
Results

In this study, we examined metagenomes of rectal swabs in 41 CC patients using whole-genome shotgun sequencing and found a significant association between molecular functions encoded by the metagenomes with markers of aggressive cancer including initial tumor size and stage. Profiling of the molecular function abundances and their distributions identified 2 microbial communities co-existing in each metagenome but with distinct metabolism and taxonomic structures. Community A (Clostridia and Proteobacteria predominant) was characterized by high activity of pathways involved in stress response, mucus glycan degradation and utilization of degradation byproducts. This community was prevalent in larger, advanced stage tumors. Conversely, community B (Bacteroidia predominant) was characterized by fast growth, active oxidative phosphorylation, and production of vitamins. This community was prevalent in small, early-stage tumors.
Conclusions

Based on these results, we propose that increased mucus layer degradation is associated with a more aggressive cervical cancer phenotype.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
415,2021,Riparian Cottonwood Trees and Adjacent River Sediments Have Different Microbial Communities and Produce Methane With Contrasting Carbon Isotope Compositions,"Rivers and their adjacent riparian forests are intimately linked by the exchange of water, nutrients, and organic matter. Both riparian cottonwood trees and adjacent river sediments host microbial communities including archeal methanogens, supporting methane production and emission to the atmosphere. Here we combine microbial community and in vitro stable isotope analyses to characterize the drivers of methane cycling in distinct anoxic habitats (river sediments vs. riparian cottonwood stems) associated with the Oldman River, southern Alberta (Canada). We demonstrate that, differences in the chemical characteristics of organic matter support divergent microbial communities that generate methane from distinct metabolic pathways. Organic matter in river sediments had C/N ratios approximately 50‐fold lower than in tree stems and had more diverse dissolved organic components. Contrasting substrate availability between river sediment and tree stems was likely the primary mechanism for the greater microbial diversity in river sediments than in tree stems, the significantly different bacterial communities, and the trend toward differing abundance of methanogen orders. The methane carbon isotope composition (δ13C values) differed for the tree stem (−103.6‰ to −70.6‰) and river sediment (−55.1‰ to −48.4‰) environments, suggesting that methane was primarily produced via CO2‐reduction in tree stems by Methanobacteriales, while river sediments produced more methane through acetate fermentation primarily by Methanosarcinales. This study demonstrates the importance of organic matter quality and microbial community composition in driving metabolic processes contributing to methane production and emission in rivers and adjacent riparian forests.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
416,2021,Evaluation of Changes to the Oral Microbiome Based on 16S rRNA Sequencing among Children Treated for Cancer,"Simple Summary Childhood cancer survivors suffer from many oral complications during and after primary therapy. Our study focuses on changes in the oral microbiome of cancer survivors. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we observed global and distinct changes in oral microbiome associated with a patient’s age and therapy duration, but not antibiotic therapy or cancer type. Observed changes in the oral microbiome could differentiate patients at higher risk of long-term oral complications. Abstract A child’s mouth is the gateway to many species of bacteria. Changes in the oral microbiome may affect the health of the entire body. The aim of the study was to evaluate the changes in the oral microbiome of childhood cancer survivors. Saliva samples before and after anti-cancer treatment were collected from 20 patients aged 6–18 years, diagnosed de novo with cancer in 2018–2019 (7 girls and 13 boys, 7.5–19 years old at the second time point). Bacterial DNA was extracted, and the microbial community profiles were assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing. The relative abundances of Cellulosilyticum and Tannerella genera were found to significantly change throughout therapy (p = 0.043 and p = 0.036, respectively). However, no differences in the alpha-diversity were observed (p = 0.817). The unsupervised classification revealed two clusters of patients: the first with significant changes in Campylobacter and Fusobacterium abundance, and the other with change in Neisseria. These two groups of patients differed in median age (10.25 vs. 16.16 years; p = 0.004) and the length of anti-cancer therapy (19 vs. 4 months; p = 0.003), but not cancer type or antibiotic treatment.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
417,2021,Strengths and caveats of identifying resistance genes from whole genome sequencing data,"ABSTRACT Introduction Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) continues to present major challenges to modern healthcare. Recent advances in whole-genome sequencing (WGS) have made the rapid molecular characterization of AMR a realistic possibility for diagnostic laboratories; yet major barriers to clinical implementation exist. Areas covered We describe and compare short- and long-read sequencing platforms, typical components of bioinformatics pipelines, tools for AMR gene detection and the relative merits of read- or assembly-based approaches. The challenges of characterizing mobile genetic elements from genomic data are outlined, as well as the complexities inherent to the prediction of phenotypic resistance from WGS. Practical obstacles to implementation in diagnostic laboratories, the critical role of quality control and external quality assurance, as well as standardized reporting standards are also discussed. Future directions, such as the application of machine-learning and artificial intelligence algorithms, linked to clinically meaningful outcomes, may offer a new paradigm for the clinical application of AMR prediction. Expert opinion AMR prediction from WGS data presents an exciting opportunity to advance our capacity to comprehensively characterize infectious pathogens in a rapid manner, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes.

This study presents data regarding the significant environmental distribution of prokaryotic bacterial taxa of a Greek stalactite core. We investigated the involvement of those bacteria communities in stalactites using a metataxonomic analysis approach of partial 16S rRNA genes. The metataxonomic analysis of stalactite core material revealed an exceptionally broad ecological spectrum of bacteria classified as members of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia, and other unclassified bacteria. We concluded that (i) the bacterial transport process is possible through water movement from the upper ground cave environment, forming cave speleothems such as stalactites, (ii) bacterial genera such as Polaromonas, Thioprofundum, and phylum Verrucomicrobia trapped inside the stalactite support the paleoecology, paleomicrobiology, and paleoclimate variations, (iii) the entrapment of certain bacteria taxa associated with water, soil, animals, and plants such as Micrococcales, Propionibacteriales, Acidimicrobiales, Pseudonocardiales, and α-, β-, and γ-Proteobacteria.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
419,2021,Seasonal diets supersede host species in shaping the distal gut microbiota of Yaks and Tibetan sheep,"Yaks and Tibetan sheep are important and renowned livestock of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Both host genetics and environmental factors can shape the composition of gut microbiota, however, there is still no consensus on which is the more dominant factor. To investigate the influence of hosts and seasons on the gut microbiome diversity component, we collected fecal samples from yaks and Tibetan sheep across different seasons (summer and winter), during which they consumed different diets. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, principal component analysis (PCoA) data showed that PCo1 explained 57.4% of the observed variance (P = 0.001) and clearly divided winter samples from summer ones, while PCo2 explained 7.1% of observed variance (P = 0.001) and mainly highlighted differences in host species. Cluster analysis data revealed that the gut microbiota composition displayed a convergence caused by season and not by genetics. Further, we profiled the gut microbial community and found that the more dominant genera in yak and Tibetan sheep microbiota were influenced by seasonal diets factors rather than genetics. This study therefore indicated that seasonal diet can trump host genetics even at higher taxonomic levels, thus providing a cautionary note for the breeding and management of these two species.",Microbiome,Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

The vast majority of intestinal bacteria carry prophages integrated into their chromosomes, but most of these bacteriophages remain uncharacterized and unexplored. ABSTRACT In this study, we describe the isolation and characterization of novel bacteriophage vB_EcoP_Kapi1 (Kapi1) isolated from a strain of commensal Escherichia coli inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract of healthy mice. We show that Kapi1 is a temperate phage integrated into tRNA argW of strain MP1 and describe its genome annotation and structure. Kapi1 shows limited homology to other characterized prophages but is most similar to the seroconverting phages of Shigella flexneri and clusters taxonomically with P22-like phages. The receptor for Kapi1 is the lipopolysaccharide O-antigen, and we further show that Kapi1 alters the structure of its host’s O-antigen in multiple ways. Kapi1 displays unstable lysogeny, and we find that the lysogenic state is more stable during growth in simulated intestinal fluid. Furthermore, Kapi1 lysogens have a competitive advantage over their nonlysogenic counterparts both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a role for Kapi1 during colonization. We thus report the use of MP1 and Kapi1 as a model system to explore the molecular mechanisms of mammalian colonization by E. coli to ask what the role(s) of prophages in this context might be. IMPORTANCE Although research exploring the microbiome has exploded in recent years, our understanding of the viral component of the microbiome is lagging far behind our understanding of the bacterial component. The vast majority of intestinal bacteria carry prophages integrated into their chromosomes, but most of these bacteriophages remain uncharacterized and unexplored. Here, we isolate and characterize a novel temperate bacteriophage infecting a commensal strain of Escherichia coli. We aim to explore the interactions between bacteriophages and their hosts in the context of the gastrointestinal tract, asking what role(s) temperate bacteriophages may play in growth and survival of bacteria in the gut. Understanding the fundamental biology of gut commensal bacteria can inform the development of novel antimicrobial or probiotic strategies for intestinal infections.","Bacteria, Virus, Microbiome","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, Interactome, AMR, Annotation",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease
422,2021,Development of Stable Mixed Microbiota for High Yield Power to Methane Conversion,"The performance of a mixed microbial community was tested in lab-scale power-to-methane reactors at 55 °C. The main aim was to uncover the responses of the community to starvation and stoichiometric H2/CO2 supply as the sole substrate. Fed-batch reactors were inoculated with the fermentation effluent of a thermophilic biogas plant. Various volumes of pure H2/CO2 gas mixtures were injected into the headspace daily and the process parameters were followed. Gas volumes and composition were measured by gas-chromatography, the headspace was replaced with N2 prior to the daily H2/CO2 injection. Total DNA samples, collected at the beginning and end (day 71), were analyzed by metagenome sequencing. Low levels of H2 triggered immediate CH4 evolution utilizing CO2/HCO3− dissolved in the fermentation effluent. Biomethanation continued when H2/CO2 was supplied. On the contrary, biomethane formation was inhibited at higher initial H2 doses and concomitant acetate formation indicated homoacetogenesis. Biomethane production started upon daily delivery of stoichiometric H2/CO2. The fed-batch operational mode allowed high H2 injection and consumption rates albeit intermittent operation conditions. Methane was enriched up to 95% CH4 content and the H2 consumption rate attained a remarkable 1000 mL·L−1·d−1.

423,2021,Microbial Transformation of Chlordecone and Two Transformation Products Formed During in situ Chemical Reduction,"Chlordecone (CLD) is a very persistent synthetic organochlorine pesticide found in the French West Indies. Recently published work has demonstrated the potential of zero-valent iron to dechlorinate CLD by in situ chemical reduction (ISCR) in soils under water-saturated conditions, forming mono- to penta-dechlorinated CLD transformation products. These transformation products are more mobile than CLD and less toxic; however, nothing is known about their further degradation, although increasing evidence of CLD biodegradation by bacteria is being found. The present study began with the enrichment from wastewater sludge of a CLD-transforming community which was then inoculated into fresh media in the presence of either CLD or two of the main ISCR transformation products, 10-monohydroCLD (-1Cl-CLD) and tri-hydroCLD (-3Cl-CLD). Carried out in triplicate batches and incubated at 38°C under anoxic conditions and in the dark, the cultures were sampled regularly during 3 months and analyzed for CLD, -1Cl-CLD, -3Cl-CLD, and possible transformation products by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. All batches showed a decrease in the amended substrates (CLD or hydroCLD). CLD degradation occurred with concomitant formation of a nine-carbon compound (pentachloroindene) and two sulfur-containing transformation products (chlordecthiol, CLD-SH; methyl chlordecsulfide, CLD-SCH3), demonstrating competing transformation pathways. In contrast, -1Cl-CLD and -3Cl-CLD only underwent a sequential reductive sulfidation/S-methylation process resulting in -1Cl-CLD-SH and -1Cl-CLD-SCH3 on the one hand, and -3Cl-CLD-SH, -3Cl-CLD-SCH3 on the other hand. Some sulfur-containing transformation products have been reported previously with single bacterial strains, but never in the presence of a complex microbial community. At the end of the experiment, bacterial and archaeal populations were investigated by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The observed diversity was mostly similar in the CLD and -1Cl-CLD conditions to the inoculum with a dominant archaea genus, Methanobacterium, and four OTU affiliated to bacteria, identified at the family (Spirochaetaceae) or genus level (Desulfovibrio, Aminobacterium, and Soehngenia). On the other hand, in the -3Cl-CLD condition, although the same OTU were found, Clostridium sensu stricto 7, Candidatus Cloacimonas, and Proteiniphilum were also present at > 2% sequences. Presence of methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria could contribute to sulfidation and S-methylation biotransformations. Overall, these results contribute to increasing our knowledge on the biodegradability of CLD and its transformation products, helping to progress toward effective remediation solutions.","Bacteria, Archaea, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,"Metabarcoding, (Meta)proteomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
424,2021,BioF is a novel B2 metallo-β-lactamase from Pseudomonas sp. isolated from an on-farm biopurification system.,"Antimicrobial resistance represents a major global health concern and environmental bacteria are considered a source of resistance genes. Carbapenems are often used as the last antibiotic option to treat multidrug-resistant bacteria. Metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) are able to render resistance to almost all β-lactam antibiotics, including carbapenems. Unfortunately, there are no inhibitors against MBLs for clinical use. Subclass B2 MBLs are the only enzymes working as strict carbapenemases, under-represented, encoded in chromosome genes and only functional as mono-zinc enzymes. Despite current efforts in MBLs inhibitor development, B2 carbapenemase activity is especially difficult to suppress, even in vitro. In this study we characterized BioF, a novel subclass B2 MBL identified in a new environmental Pseudomonas sp. strain isolated from an on-farm biopurification system (BPS). Although blaBioF is most likely a chromosomal gene, it is found in a genomic island and may represent a step previous to the horizontal transmission of B2 genes. The new B2 MBL is active as a mono-zinc enzyme and is a potent carbapenemase with incipient activity against some cephalosporins. BioF activity is not affected by excess zinc and is only inhibited at high metal chelator concentrations. The discovery and characterization of B2 MBL BioF as a potent carbapenemase in a BPS bacterial isolate emphasizes the importance of exploring antibiotic resistances existing in the environmental microbiota under the influence of human activities before they could emerge clinically.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Isolate, Functional analysis, AMR",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
425,2021,Evaluation of whole-genome sequencing-based subtyping methods for the surveillance of Shigella spp. and the confounding effect of mobile genetic elements in long-term outbreaks,"Many public health laboratories across the world have implemented whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for the surveillance and outbreak detection of foodborne pathogens. PulseNet-affiliated laboratories have determined that most single-strain foodborne outbreaks are contained within 0–10 multi-locus sequence typing (MLST)-based allele differences and/or core genome single-nucleotide variants (SNVs). In addition to being a food- and travel-associated outbreak pathogen, most Shigella spp. cases occur through continuous person-to-person transmission, predominantly involving men who have sex with men (MSM), leading to long-term and recurrent outbreaks. Continuous transmission patterns coupled to genetic evolution under antibiotic treatment pressure require an assessment of existing WGS-based subtyping methods and interpretation criteria for cluster inclusion/exclusion. An evaluation of 4 WGS-based subtyping methods [SNVPhyl, coreMLST, core genome MLST (cgMLST) and whole-genome MLST (wgMLST)] was performed on 9 foodborne-, travel- and MSM-related retrospective outbreaks from a collection of 91 Shigella flexneri and 232  Shigella sonnei isolates to determine the methods’ epidemiological concordance, discriminatory power, robustness and ability to generate stable interpretation criteria. The discriminatory powers were ranked as follows: coreMLST<SNVPhyl<cgMLST<wgMLST (range: 0.970–1.000). The genetic differences observed for non-MSM-related Shigella spp. outbreaks respect the standard 0–10 allele/SNV guideline; however, mobile genetic element (MGE)-encoded loci caused inflated genetic variation and discrepant phylogenies for prolonged MSM-related S. sonnei outbreaks via wgMLST. The S. sonnei correlation coefficients of wgMLST were also the lowest at 0.680, 0.703 and 0.712 for SNVPhyl, coreMLST and cgMLST, respectively. Plasmid maintenance, mobilization and conjugation-associated genes were found to be the main source of genetic distance inflation in addition to prophage-related genes. Duplicated alleles arising from the repeated nature of IS elements were also responsible for many false cg/wgMLST differences. The coreMLST approach was shown to be the most robust, followed by SNVPhyl and wgMLST for inter-laboratory comparability. Our results highlight the need for validating species-specific subtyping methods based on microbial genome plasticity and outbreak dynamics in addition to the importance of filtering confounding MGEs for cluster detection.","Virus, Pathogen","Isolate, (M)LST, Variant",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease
426,2021,The impact of the Th17:Treg axis on the IgA-Biome across the glycemic spectrum,"Secretory IgA (SIgA) is released into mucosal surfaces where its function extends beyond that of host defense to include the shaping of resident microbial communities by mediating exclusion/inclusion of respective microbes and regulating bacterial gene expression. In this capacity, SIgA acts as the fulcrum on which host immunity and the health of the microbiota are balanced. We recently completed an analysis of the gut and salivary IgA-Biomes (16S rDNA sequencing of SIgA-coated/uncoated bacteria) in Mexican-American adults that identified IgA-Biome differences across the glycemic spectrum. As Th17:Treg ratio imbalances are associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis and chronic inflammatory conditions such as type 2 diabetes, the present study extends our prior work by examining the impact of Th17:Treg ratios (pro-inflammatory:anti-inflammatory T-cell ratios) and the SIgA response (Th17:Treg-SIgA axis) in shaping microbial communities. Examining the impact of Th17:Treg ratios (determined by epigenetic qPCR lymphocyte subset quantification) on the IgA-Biome across diabetes phenotypes identified a proportional relationship between Th17:Treg ratios and alpha diversity in the stool IgA-Biome of those with dysglycemia, significant changes in community composition of the stool and salivary microbiomes across glycemic profiles, and genera preferentially abundant by T-cell inflammatory phenotype. This is the first study to associate epigenetically quantified Th17:Treg ratios with both the larger and SIgA-fractionated microbiome, assess these associations in the context of a chronic inflammatory disease, and offers a novel frame through which to evaluate mucosal microbiomes in the context of host responses and inflammation.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis",Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
427,2021,Genome features and antibiotic resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated in patients with cystic fibrosis in the Russian Federation.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common genetic disease, manifested by airway obstruction and chronic respiratory infection. The most prevalent infectious agent in airways of CF patients is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This study aimed to determine sequence-types, antimicrobial resistance phenotypes and genes defining adaptive antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa isolates recovered from CF patients in Russia. In total, 84 P. aeruginosa strains from 64 CF patients were analyzed. Susceptibility to antibiotics was determined by disk diffusion test. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on MGISEQ-2000 platform. SPAdes software, Galaxy, ResFinder, PubMLST were used for analysis of WGS data. Examined P. aeruginosa isolates belonged to 53 different sequence-types (STs), including 6 new STs. High-risk epidemic clone ST235 (10%) and clonal CF P. aeruginosa strains ST17, ST242, ST274 (7%) were detected. Non-susceptibility to ticarcillin-clavulanate, cefepime, imipenem was observed in 63%, 12% and 25% of isolates, respectively; to tobramycin - in 24%, to amikacin - in 35%; to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin - in 35% and 57% of strains, respectively. Multidrug-resistant phenotype was detected in 18% of isolates. In examined strains, genes of beta-lactamases VIM-2 (5 ST235 strains), VEB-1 (two ST2592 strains), GES-1 (1 ST235 strain), PER-1 (1 ST235 strain) were found. Ciprofloxacin-modifying enzyme CrpP gene was detected in 67% of isolates, aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes AAD, ANT, AAC genes - in 7%, 4%, 12% of strains, respectively. P. aeruginosa isolates from CF patients in Russia demonstrate a high clonal diversity, which is similar to other P. aeruginosa infections.

428,2021,Cross-Talk Between Intestinal Microbiota and Host Gene Expression in Gilthead Sea Bream (Sparus aurata) Juveniles: Insights in Fish Feeds for Increased Circularity and Resource Utilization,"New types of fish feed based on processed animal proteins (PAPs), insect meal, yeast, and microbial biomasses have been used with success in gilthead sea bream. However, some drawback effects on feed conversion and inflammatory systemic markers were reported in different degrees with PAP- and non-PAP-based feed formulations. Here, we focused on the effects of control and two experimental diets on gut mucosal-adherent microbiota, and how it correlated with host transcriptomics at the local (intestine) and systemic (liver and head kidney) levels. The use of tissue-specific PCR-arrays of 93 genes in total rendered 13, 12, and 9 differentially expressed (DE) genes in the intestine, liver, and head kidney, respectively. Illumina sequencing of gut microbiota yielded a mean of 125,350 reads per sample, assigned to 1,281 operational taxonomic unit (OTUs). Bacterial richness and alpha diversity were lower in fish fed with the PAP diet, and discriminant analysis displayed 135 OTUs driving the separation between groups with 43 taxa correlating with 27 DE genes. The highest expression of intestinal pcna and alpi was achieved in PAP fish with intermediate values in non-PAP, being the pro-inflammatory action of alpi associated with the presence of Psychrobacter piscatorii. The intestinal muc13 gene was down-regulated in non-PAP fish, with this gene being negatively correlated with anaerobic (Chloroflexi and Anoxybacillus) and metal-reducing (Pelosinus and Psychrosinus) bacteria. Other inflammatory markers (igm, il8, tnfα) were up-regulated in PAP fish, positively correlating the intestinal igm gene with the inflammasome activator Escherichia/Shigella, whereas the systemic expression of il8 and tnfα was negatively correlated with the Bacilli class in PAP fish and positively correlated with Paracoccus yeei in non-PAP fish. Overall changes in the expression pattern of il10, galectins (lgals1, lgals8), and toll-like receptors (tlr2, tlr5, tlr9) reinforced the anti-inflammatory profile of fish fed with the non-PAP diet, with these gene markers being associated with a wide range of OTUs. A gut microbiota-liver axis was also established, linking the microbial generation of short chain fatty acids with the fueling of scd1- and elovl6-mediated lipogenesis. In summary, by correlating the microbiome with host gene expression, we offer new insights in the evaluation of fish diets promoting gut and metabolism homeostasis, and ultimately, the health of farmed fish.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,(Meta)transcriptomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
429,2021,Metavirome Survey of Eight Ray-Finned Fishes Revealed Domination of Giant Viral Members of Pandoravirus and Megaviricetes,"
 Background

Fishes are an essential source of food all around the world. The bulk of the microbial diversity in marine ecosystems is uncharacterized, with viruses accounting for most of the remaining diversity. This may be a major danger to public health, therefore knowing the variety of viruses in the marine ecosystem is critical. The goal was to assess the virome of ray-finned fishes in terms of variety and relation to human diseases.
Results

It was revealed that the viral kingdom was allocated 2,228,888 sequence reads. The pooled genome assay of the ray-finned fishes indicated a significant abundance of viruses in three clades of the genus Pandoravirus (31%), the order of Herepesvirales (23%), and the kingdom of Bamfordvirae (10%). Furthermore, 432281/2031445 reads (21%) of mapped reads were unassigned viruses. According to the GiantVirusFinder findings, 17931 hits (4.15$) were mapped to the genomes of known giantviruses.
Conclusion

Humans eat seafood regularly as one of their primary diets. Ray-finned fishes have a long evolutionary history and, as demonstrated here, are hosts to a variety of large DNA viruses. Fish must be screened for viral infections that are linked to human illnesses.",Virus,Community (taxonomy) profiling,(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
430,2021,Natural Horizontal Gene Transfer of Antimicrobial Resistance Genes in Campylobacter spp. From Turkeys and Swine,"Antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter constitutes a serious threat to public health. The clonal expansion of resistant strains and/or the horizontal spread of resistance genes to other strains and species can hinder the clinical effectiveness of antibiotics to treat severe campylobacteriosis. Still, gaps exist in our understanding of the risks of acquisition and spread of antibiotic resistance in Campylobacter. While the in vitro transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes between Campylobacter species via natural transformation has been extensively demonstrated, experimental studies have favored the use of naked DNA to obtain transformants. In this study, we used experimental designs closer to real-world conditions to evaluate the possible transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes between Campylobacter strains of the same or different species (Campylobacter coli or Campylobacter jejuni) and originating from different animal hosts (swine or turkeys). This was evaluated in vitro through co-culture experiments and in vivo with dual-strain inoculation of turkeys, followed by whole genome sequencing of parental and newly emerged strains. In vitro, we observed four independent horizontal gene transfer events leading to the acquisition of resistance to beta-lactams (blaOXA), aminoglycosides [aph(2′′)-If and rpsL] and tetracycline [tet(O)]. Observed events involved the displacement of resistance-associated genes by a mutated version, or the acquisition of genomic islands harboring a resistance determinant by homologous recombination; we did not detect the transfer of resistance-carrying plasmids even though they were present in some strains. In vivo, we recovered a newly emerged strain with dual-resistance pattern and identified the replacement of an existing non-functional tet(O) by a functional tet(O) in the recipient strain. Whole genome comparisons allowed characterization of the events involved in the horizontal spread of resistance genes between Campylobacter following in vitro co-culture and in vivo dual inoculation. Our study also highlights the potential for antimicrobial resistance transfer across Campylobacter species originating from turkeys and swine, which may have implications for farms hosting both species in close proximity.",Bacteria,"Functional analysis, AMR",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease
431,2021,A CURE for Salmonella: A Laboratory Course in Pathogen Microbiology and Genomics,"Rapid advances in genomics and bioinformatics, the vast amount of data generated by next-generation sequencing, and the penetration of the ‘-omics’ into many areas of biology have created a need for students with hands-on experience with computational and ‘big data’ methods. Additionally, laboratory experience in the isolation, identification, and characterization of unknown bacteria is a vital part of a microbiology student’s training. This lesson is a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) focusing on Salmonella enterica, a common and relatively low-virulence foodborne pathogen. In Module 1, students isolate and identify S. enterica strains from stream sediment, poultry litter, or other sources. They conduct phenotypic evaluation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and can search for plasmids. Isolates’ whole genomes may be sequenced by the United States FDA or public health laboratories, typically at no charge. In Module 2, students learn basic methods of genome assembly, analysis, annotation, and comparative genomics. They use easily accessible, primarily web-based tools to assemble their genomes and investigate areas of interest including serotype, AMR genes, and in silico evidence of mobile genetic elements. Either module can be used as a standalone learning experience. After course completion, students will be able to isolate and identify Salmonella from natural sources, and use computational analysis of microbial genomic data, particularly of the Enterobacteriaceae. This lesson offers undergraduate microbiologists a genuine research experience and a real-world microbiology application in genomic epidemiology, as well as a valuable mix of field, laboratory, and computational skills and experiences.

432,2021,"Shifts in Soil Structure, Biological, and Functional Diversity Under Long-Term Carbon Deprivation","Soil organic matter is composed of a variety of carbon (C) forms. However, not all forms are equally accessible to soil microorganisms. Deprivation of C inputs will cause changes in the physical and microbial community structures of soils; yet the trajectories of such changes are not clear. We assessed microbial communities using phospholipid fatty acid profiling, metabarcoding, CO2 emissions, and functional gene microarrays in a decade-long C deprivation field experiment. We also assessed changes in a range of soil physicochemical properties, including using X-ray Computed Tomography imaging to assess differences in soil structure. Two sets of soils were deprived of C inputs by removing plant inputs for 10 years and 1 year, respectively. We found a reduction in diversity measures, after 10 years of C deprivation, which was unexpected based on previous research. Fungi appeared to be most impacted, likely due to competition for scarce resources after exhausting the available plant material. This suggestion was supported by evidence of bioindicator taxa in non-vegetated soils that may directly compete with or consume fungi. There was also a reduction in copies of most functional genes after 10 years of C deprivation, though gene copies increased for phytase and some genes involved in decomposing recalcitrant C and methanogenesis. Additionally, soils under C deprivation displayed expected reductions in pH, organic C, nitrogen, and biomass as well as reduced mean pore size, especially in larger pores. However, pore connectivity increased after 10 years of C deprivation contrary to expectations. Our results highlight concurrent collapse of soil structure and biodiversity following long-term C deprivation. Overall, this study shows the negative trajectory of continuous C deprivation and loss of organic matter on a wide range of soil quality indicators and microorganisms.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis","Metabarcoding, Imaging",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
433,2021,Differential perturbations of gut microbial profiles and co‐occurrence networks among phases of methamphetamine‐induced conditioned place preference,"The gut–brain axis provides a pathway for the interaction between gut microbiota and methamphetamine (METH) addiction. However, the gut microbial signatures during different phases of METH use remain unclear. In the present study, we established models of acquisition, extinction, and reinstatement of METH‐induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in male mice and detected the gut microbiome profiles of the fecal samples at the three phases by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Our results revealed that the richness of the gut microbiome increased following repeated METH administration, and it decreased after 4 weeks of abstinence. The microbial richness remained at a low level after one METH challenge at the reinstatement phase. The abundance of several genera including Prevotella, Bacteroides, and Lactobacillus differentially altered among phases of METH‐induced CPP. The co‐occurrence networks of the gut microbiome became weaker and more unstable during the development of METH‐induced CPP at the extinction and reinstatement phases. Notably, the predicted gene functions of short‐chain fatty acid metabolism, which were correlated with the abundance of Prevotella, Bacteroides, and Lactobacillus, were found differentially enriched among phases of METH‐induced CPP. Our findings highlight a potential association between perturbations of the gut microbiome and different phases of METH use.",Microbiome,"Functional analysis, Interactome",Metabarcoding,
434,2021,Redox-mediated inactivation of the transcriptional repressor C3600 makes uropathogenic Escherichia coli exquisitely resistant to reactive chlorine species,"The ability to overcome stressful environments is critical for pathogen survival in the host. One challenge for bacteria is the exposure to reactive chlorine species (RCS), which are generated by innate immune cells as critical part of the oxidative burst. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is the most potent antimicrobial RCS and associated with extensive macromolecular damage in the phagocytized pathogen. However, bacteria have evolved defense strategies to alleviate the effects of HOCl-mediated damage. Among these are RCS-sensing transcriptional regulators that control the expression of HOCl-protective genes under non- and HOCl stress. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), the major causative agent of urinary tract infections (UTIs), is particularly exposed to infiltrating neutrophils during pathogenesis, however, their responses to and defenses of HOCl are still completely unexplored. Here, we present evidence that UPEC strains tolerate higher levels of HOCl and are better protected from neutrophil-mediated killing compared to other E. coli. Transcriptomic analysis of HOCl-stressed UPEC revealed the upregulation of an operon consisting of three genes, one of which encodes the transcriptional regulator C3600. We identified C3600 as a HOCl-sensing transcriptional repressor, which, under non-stress conditions, is bound to the operator and represses the expression of its target genes. During HOCl exposure, however, the repressor forms reversible intermolecular disulfide bonds and dissociates from the DNA resulting in the de-repression of the operon. Deletion of one of the target genes renders UPEC significantly more susceptible to HOCl indicating that the HOCl-mediated induction of the regulon plays a major role for UPEC’s HOCl resistance. IMPORTANCE How do pathogens deal with antimicrobial oxidants produced by the innate immune system during infection? Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), the most common etiological agent of urinary tract infections (UTIs), is particularly exposed to infiltrating neutrophils and, therefore, must counter elevated levels of the antimicrobial oxidant HOCl to establish infection. Our study provides fundamentally new insights into a defense mechanism that enables UPEC to fend off the toxic effects of HOCl stress. Intriguingly, the defense system is predominantly found in UPEC and absent in non-invasive enteropathogenic E. coli. Our data suggest that expression of the target gene c3601 is exclusively responsible for UPEC’s increased HOCl tolerance in culture and therefore potentially contributes to UPEC’s survival during phagocytosis. Thus, this novel HOCl stress defense system could potentially serve as an attractive drug target to increase the body’s own capacity to fight UTIs.","Bacteria, Pathogen",AMR,(Meta)transcriptomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
435,2021,"Production, Storage Stability, and Susceptibility Testing of Reuterin and Its Impact on the Murine Fecal Microbiome and Volatile Organic Compound Profile","Background: Probiotics are generally considered as safe, but infections may rarely occur in vulnerable patients. Alternatives to live microorganisms to manage dysbiosis may be of interest in these patients. Reuterin is a complex component system exhibiting broad spectrum antimicrobial activity and a possible candidate substance in these cases. Methods: Reuterin supernatant was cultured from Lentilactobacillus diolivorans in a bioreactor in a two-step process. Storage stability at −20°C and effect of repeated freeze-thaw cycles were assessed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Antimicrobial activity was tested against Clostridium difficile, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus (S.) aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus (S.) agalactiae, Propionibacterium acnes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosae. Male BALBc mice were gavage fed with reuterin supernatant (n = 10) or culture medium (n = 10). Fecal volatile organic compounds (VOC) were assessed by gas chromatography mass spectroscopy; the microbiome was examined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Results: The supernatant contained 13.4 g/L reuterin (3-hydroxypropionaldehyde; 3-HPA). 3-HPA content remained stable at −20°C for 35 days followed by a slow decrease of its concentration. Repeated freezing/thawing caused a slow 3-HPA decrease. Antimicrobial activity was encountered against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. agalactiae. Microbiome analysis showed no differences in alpha and beta diversity markers. Linear discriminant effect size (LEfSe) analysis identified Lachnospiraceae_bacterium_COE1 and Ruminoclostridium_5_uncultured_Clostridiales_ bacterium (in the reuterin medium group) and Desulfovibrio_uncultured_ bacterium, Candidatus Arthromitus, Ruminococcae_NK4A214_group, and Eubacterium_xylanophilum_group (in the reuterin group) as markers for group differentiation. VOC analysis showed a significant decrease of heptane and increase of 3-methylbutanal in the reuterin group. Conclusion: The supernatant produced in this study contained acceptable amounts of 3-HPA remaining stable for 35 days at −20°C and exhibiting an antimicrobial effect against S. aureus, S. agalactiae, and S. epidermidis. Under in vivo conditions, the reuterin supernatant caused alterations of the fecal microbiome. In the fecal, VOC analysis decreased heptane and increased 3-methylbutanal were encountered. These findings suggest the high potential of the reuterin system to influence the intestinal microbiome in health and disease, which needs to be examined in detail in future projects.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR",Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
436,2021,The Potential Role of Clinical Metagenomics in Infectious Diseases: Therapeutic Perspectives,"Clinical metagenomics (CMg) is the process of sequencing nucleic acid of clinical samples to obtain clinically relevant information such as the identification of microorganisms and their susceptibility to antimicrobials. Over the last decades, sequencing and bioinformatic solutions supporting CMg have much evolved and an increasing number of case reports and series covering various infectious diseases have been published. Metagenomics is a new approach to infectious disease diagnosis that is currently being developed and is certainly one of the most promising for the coming years. However, most CMg studies are retrospective, and few address the potential impact CMg could have on patient management, including initiation, adaptation, or cessation of antimicrobials. In this narrative review, we have discussed the potential role of CMg in bacteriology, virology, mycology, and parasitology. Several reports and case-series confirm that CMg is an innovative tool with which one can (i) identify more microorganisms than with conventional methods in a single test, (ii) obtain results within hours, and (iii) tailor the antimicrobial regimen of patients. However, the cost-efficiency of CMg and its real impact on patient management are still to be determined.",Bacteria,AMR,"(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Health & Disease
437,2021,New Insect Host Defense Peptides (HDP) From Dung Beetle (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) Transcriptomes,"Abstract The Coleoptera Scarabaeidae family is one of the most diverse groups of insects on the planet, which live in complex microbiological environments. Their immune systems have evolved diverse families of Host Defense Peptides (HDP) with strong antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities. However, there are several peptide sequences that await discovery in this group of organisms. This would pave the way to identify molecules with promising therapeutic potential. This work retrieved two sources of information: 1) De-novo transcriptomic data from two species of neotropical Scarabaeidae (Dichotomius satanas and Ontophagus curvicornis); 2) Sequence data deposited in available databases. A Blast-based search was conducted against the transcriptomes with a subset of sequences representative of the HDP. This work reports 155 novel HDP sequences identified in nine transcriptomes from seven species of Coleoptera: D. satanas (n = 76; 49.03%), O. curvicornis (n = 23; 14.83%), (Trypoxylus dichotomus) (n = 18; 11.61%), (Onthophagus nigriventris) (n = 10; 6.45%), (Heterochelus sp) (n = 6; 3.87%), (Oxysternon conspicillatum) (n = 18; 11.61%), and (Popillia japonica) (n = 4; 2.58%). These sequences were identified based on similarity to known HDP insect families. New members of defensins (n = 58; 37.42%), cecropins (n = 18; 11.61%), attancins (n = 41; 26.45%), and coleoptericins (n = 38; 24.52%) were described based on their physicochemical and structural characteristics, as well as their sequence relationship to other insect HDPs. Therefore, the Scarabaeidae family is a complex and rich group of insects with a great diversity of antimicrobial peptides with potential antimicrobial activity.",,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR",(Meta)transcriptomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

A major part of the maturation of the oral microbiome occurs during the first two years of life, and this development may be influenced by early life circumstances. Our goal in this chapter is to provide a large understanding of the strategies employed by oral bacteria and evidence for the formation of the oral microbiome during early childhood, the potential of using childhood oral microbiome to predict future oral and systemic diseases, and the control of the current evidence. We debate the factors that impact development of the oral microbiome and explore oral markers of disease, with a focus on the early oral cavity.","Bacteria, Virus, Archaea, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,,Health & Disease
439,2021,Overcoming Data Bottlenecks in Genomic Pathogen Surveillance,"Abstract Performing whole genome sequencing (WGS) for the surveillance of antimicrobial resistance offers the ability to determine not only the antimicrobials to which rates of resistance are increasing, but also the evolutionary mechanisms and transmission routes responsible for the increase at local, national, and global scales. To derive WGS-based outputs, a series of processes are required, beginning with sample and metadata collection, followed by nucleic acid extraction, library preparation, sequencing, and analysis. Throughout this pathway there are many data-related operations required (informatics) combined with more biologically focused procedures (bioinformatics). For a laboratory aiming to implement pathogen genomics, the informatics and bioinformatics activities can be a barrier to starting on the journey; for a laboratory that has already started, these activities may become overwhelming. Here we describe these data bottlenecks and how they have been addressed in laboratories in India, Colombia, Nigeria, and the Philippines, as part of the National Institute for Health Research Global Health Research Unit on Genomic Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance. The approaches taken include the use of reproducible data parsing pipelines and genome sequence analysis workflows, using technologies such as Data-flo, the Nextflow workflow manager, and containerization of software dependencies. By overcoming barriers to WGS implementation in countries where genome sampling for some species may be underrepresented, a body of evidence can be built to determine the concordance of antimicrobial sensitivity testing and genome-derived resistance, and novel high-risk clones and unknown mechanisms of resistance can be discovered.",Pathogen,AMR,(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease
440,2021,Social environment and genetics underlie body site‐specific microbiomes of Yellowstone National Park gray wolves (Canis lupus),"Abstract The host‐associated microbiome is an important player in the ecology and evolution of species. Despite growing interest in the medical, veterinary, and conservation communities, there remain numerous questions about the primary factors underlying microbiota, particularly in wildlife. We bridged this knowledge gap by leveraging microbial, genetic, and observational data collected in a wild, pedigreed population of gray wolves (Canis lupus) inhabiting Yellowstone National Park. We characterized body site‐specific microbes across six haired and mucosal body sites (and two fecal samples) using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. At the phylum level, we found that the microbiome of gray wolves primarily consists of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, and Proteobacteria, consistent with previous studies within Mammalia and Canidae. At the genus level, we documented body site‐specific microbiota with functions relevant to microenvironment and local physiological processes. We additionally employed observational and RAD sequencing data to examine genetic, demographic, and environmental correlates of skin and gut microbiota. We surveyed individuals across several levels of pedigree relationships, generations, and social groups, and found that social environment (i.e., pack) and genetic relatedness were two primary factors associated with microbial community composition to differing degrees between body sites. We additionally reported body condition and coat color as secondary factors underlying gut and skin microbiomes, respectively. We concluded that gray wolf microbiota resemble similar host species, differ between body sites, and are shaped by numerous endogenous and exogenous factors. These results provide baseline information for this long‐term study population and yield important insights into the evolutionary history, ecology, and conservation of wild wolves and their associated microbes.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis",Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
441,2021,Spore Germination of the Obligate Biotroph Spongospora subterranea: Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Germination Associated Genes,"For soilborne pathogens, germination of the resting or dormant propagule that enables persistence within the soil environment is a key point in pathogenesis. Spongospora subterranea is an obligate soilborne protozoan that infects the roots and tubers of potato causing root and powdery scab disease for which there are currently no effective controls. A better understanding of the molecular basis of resting spore germination of S. subterranea could be important for development of novel disease interventions. However, as an obligate biotroph and soil dwelling organism, the application of new omics techniques for the study of the pre-infection process in S. subterranea has been problematic. Here, RNA sequencing was used to analyse the reprogramming of S. subterranea resting spores during the transition to zoospores in an in-vitro model. More than 63 million mean high-quality reads per sample were generated from the resting and germinating spores. By using a combination of reference-based and de novo transcriptome assembly, 6,664 unigenes were identified. The identified unigenes were subsequently annotated based on known proteins using BLAST search. Of 5,448 annotated genes, 570 genes were identified to be differentially expressed during the germination of S. subterranea resting spores, with most of the significant genes belonging to transcription and translation, amino acids biosynthesis, transport, energy metabolic processes, fatty acid metabolism, stress response and DNA repair. The datasets generated in this study provide a basic knowledge of the physiological processes associated with spore germination and will facilitate functional predictions of novel genes in S. subterranea and other plasmodiophorids. We introduce several candidate genes related to the germination of an obligate biotrophic soilborne pathogen which could be applied to the development of antimicrobial agents for soil inoculum management.",Pathogen,"Functional analysis, AMR, MAGs",(Meta)transcriptomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
442,2021,Characterization and protective effects of lytic bacteriophage pAh6.2TG against a pathogenic multidrug-resistant Aeromonas hydrophila in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus).,"Bacteriophage (phage) is considered as one of the alternatives to antibiotics and an environmentally friendly approach to tackle antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in aquaculture. Here, we reported isolation, morphology and genomic characterizations of a newly isolated lytic phage, designated pAh6.2TG. Host range and stability of pAh6.2TG in different environmental conditions, and protective efficacy against a pathogenic multidrug-resistant (MDR) Aeromonas hydrophila in Nile tilapia were subsequently evaluated. The results showed that pAh6.2TG is a member of the new family Chaseviridae which has genome size of 51,780 bp, encoding 65 putative open reading frames (ORFs), and is most closely related to Aeromonas phage PVN02 (99.33% nucleotide identity). The pAh6.2TG was highly specific to A. hydrophila and infected 83.3% tested strains of MDR A. hydrophila (10 out of 12) with relative stability at pH 7 - 9, temperature 0 - 40° C and salinity 0 - 40 ppt. In experimental challenge, pAh6.2TG treatments significantly improved survivability of Nile tilapia exposed to a lethal dose of the pathogenic MDR A. hydrophila, with relative percent survival (RPS) of 73.3% and 50% for phage multiplicity of infection (MOI) 1.0 and 0.1, respectively. Phage treatment significantly reduced the concentration of A. hydrophila in both water and fish body. Interestingly, the surviving fish from A. hydrophila challenged groups provoked specific antibody (IgM) against this bacterium. In summary, the findings suggested that the lytic phage pAh6.2TG is an effective alternative to antibiotics to control MDR A. hydrophila in tilapia and possibly other freshwater fish.

443,2021,"Prokaryotic, Fungal, and Unicellular Eukaryotic Core Communities Across Three Sympatric Marine Sponges From the Southwestern Atlantic Coast Are Dominated Largely by Deterministic Assemblage Processes","Marine sponges are known to harbor a diverse and complex microbiota; however, a vast majority of surveys have been investigating the prokaryotic communities in the north hemisphere and Australia. In addition, the mechanisms of microbial community assembly are poorly understood in this pivotal player of the ecosystem. Thus, this survey addressed the holobiome of the sponge species in the São Paulo region (Brazil) for the first time and investigated the contribution of neutral and niche processes of prokaryotic, fungal, and unicellular eukaryotic assemblage in three sympatric species Aplysina caissara, Aplysina fulva, and Tedania ignis along with environmental samples. The compositions of the holobiome associated with the sponges and detected in environmental samples were strikingly different. Remarkably, between 47 and 88% of the assigned operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were specifically associated with sponge species. Moreover, around 77, 69, and 53% of the unclassified OTUs from prokaryotic, fungal, and unicellular eukaryotic communities, respectively, showed less than 97% similarity with well-known databases, suggesting that sponges from the southwestern Atlantic coast are an important source of microbial novelty. These values are even higher, around 80 and 61% of the unclassified OTUs, when excluding low abundance samples from fungal and unicellular eukaryotic datasets, respectively. Host species were the major driver shaping the sponge-associated microbial community. Deterministic processes were primarily responsible for the assembly of microbial communities in all sponge species, while neutral processes of prokaryotic and fungal community assembly were also detected in the sympatric A. caissara and T. ignis replicates, respectively. Most of the species-rich sponge-associated lineages from this region are also found in the Northern seas and many of them might play essential roles in the symbioses, such as biosynthesis of secondary metabolites that exhibit antimicrobial and antiviral activities, as well as provide protection against host predation. Overall, in this study the microbiota was assembled by interactions with the host sponge in a deterministic-based manner; closely related sponge species shared a strong phylogenetic signal in their associated prokaryotic and fungal community traits and Brazilian sponges were a reservoir of novel microbial species.","Bacteria, Eukaryote, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Interactome, AMR, MAGs",Metabolomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
444,2021,Different Reactions in Each Enterotype Depending on the Intake of Probiotic Yogurt Powder,"Probiotics can be used as a nutritional strategy to improve gut homeostasis. We aimed to evaluate the intestinal microbiota profile of 18 subjects after ingestion of probiotic yogurt powder (PYP) based on enterotype. The subjects were classified into three enterotypes according to their microbial community: Bacteroides (n = 9, type B), Prevotella (n = 3, type P), and Ruminococcus (n = 6, type R). We performed controlled termination in a transient series that included a control period of three weeks before probiotic intake, PYP intake for three weeks, and a three-week washout period. Fecal microbiota composition was analyzed by sequencing the V3–V4 super variable region of 16S rRNA. Based on the Bristol stool shape scale, abnormal stool shape improved with PYP intake, and bowel movements were activated. The abundance of Faecalibacterium, Eggerthella, and Leuconostoc, which ferment and metabolize glucose, showed a strong correlation with type B Bacteroides, and glucose metabolism improvement was observed in all type B subjects. Alkaline phosphatase was significantly improved only in type B. In addition, the abundance of type B Bacteroides showed a negative correlation with that of Lactobacillus. The abundance of Streptococcus, Agathobacter, and Christensenella, which are involved in lipid metabolism, showed a strong correlation with that of type P Prevotella, and triglyceride metabolism improvement was observed in all type P subjects. The gut microbiota showed only short-term changes after PYP intake and showed resilience by returning to its original state when PYP intake was interrupted. In summary, the different responses to PYP intake may result from the different enterotypes and associated strains; therefore, the probiotic composition should be adjusted based on the individual enterotype.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
445,2021,(S)-Reutericyclin: Susceptibility Testing and In Vivo Effect on Murine Fecal Microbiome and Volatile Organic Compounds,"We aimed to assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity and the in vivo effect on the murine fecal microbiome and volatile organic compound (VOC) profile of (S)-reutericyclin. The antimicrobial activity of (S)-reutericyclin was tested against Clostridium difficile, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus (S.) epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Propionibacterium acnes. Reutericyclin or water were gavage fed to male BALBc mice for 7 weeks. Thereafter stool samples underwent 16S based microbiome analysis and VOC analysis by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). (S)-reutericyclin inhibited growth of S. epidermidis only. Oral (S)-reutericyclin treatment caused a trend towards reduced alpha diversity. Beta diversity was significantly influenced by reutericyclin. Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) analysis showed an increase of Streptococcus and Muribaculum as well as a decrease of butyrate producing Ruminoclostridium, Roseburia and Eubacterium in the reutericyclin group. VOC analysis revealed significant increases of pentane and heptane and decreases of 2,3-butanedione and 2-heptanone in reutericyclin animals. The antimicrobial activity of (S)-reutericyclin differs from reports of (R)-reutericyclin with inhibitory effects on a multitude of Gram-positive bacteria reported in the literature. In vivo (S)-reutericyclin treatment led to a microbiome shift towards dysbiosis and distinct alterations of the fecal VOC profile.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR","Metabarcoding, (Meta)proteomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
446,2021,"Prevalence of Antimicrobial Resistance and Characteristics of Escherichia coli Isolates From Fecal and Manure Pit Samples on Dairy Farms in the Province of Québec, Canada","Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an important burden for public health and veterinary medicine. For Québec (Canada) dairy farms, the prevalence of AMR is mostly described using passive surveillance, which may be misleading. In addition, the presence of extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)/AmpC producing Escherichia coli is unknown. This observational cross-sectional study used random dairy farms (n = 101) to investigate AMR and extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)/AmpC producing Escherichia coli. Twenty antimicrobials were tested on E. coli isolates (n = 593) recovered from fecal samples (n = 599) from calves, cows, and the manure pit. Isolates were mostly susceptible (3% AMR or less) to the highest priority critically important antimicrobials in humans. The highest levels of AMR were to tetracycline (26%), sulfisozaxole (23%) and streptomycin (19%). The resistance genes responsible for these resistances were, respectively: tet(A), tet(B), sul1, sul2, sul3, aph(3”)-Ib (strA), aph(6)-Id (strB), aadA1, aadA2, and aadA5. ESBL analysis revealed two predominant phenotypes: AmpC (51%) and ESBL (46%) where blaCMY−2 and blaCTX−M (blaCTX−M−1, blaCTX−M−15, and blaCTX−M−55) were the genes responsible for these phenotypes, respectively. During this study, 85% of farms had at least one ESBL/AmpC producing E. coli. Isolates from calves were more frequently resistant than those from cows or manure pits. Although prevalence of AMR was low for critically important antimicrobials, there was a high prevalence of ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli on Quebec dairy farms, particularly in calves. Those data will help determine a baseline for AMR to evaluate impact of initiatives aimed at reducing AMR.",,"Isolate, AMR",,Health & Disease
447,2021,Side Effects of Pesticides and Metabolites in Groundwater: Impact on Denitrification,"The impact of two pesticides (S-metolachlor and propiconazole) and their respective main metabolites (ESA-metolachlor and 1,2,4-triazole) on bacterial denitrification in groundwater was studied. For this, the denitrification activity and the bacterial diversity of a microbial community sampled from a nitrate-contaminated groundwater were monitored during 20 days in lab experiments in the presence or absence of pesticides or metabolites at 2 or 10 μg/L. The kinetics of nitrate reduction along with nitrite and N2O production all suggested that S-metolachlor had no or only little impact, whereas its metabolite ESA-metolachlor inhibited denitrification by 65% at 10 μg/L. Propiconazole and 1,2,4-triazole also inhibited denitrification at both concentrations, but to a lesser extent (29–38%) than ESA-metolachlor. When inhibition occurred, pesticides affected the reduction of nitrate into nitrite step. However, no significant differences were detected on the abundance of nitrate reductase narG and napA genes, suggesting an impact of pesticides/metabolites at the protein level rather than on denitrifying bacteria abundance. 16S rRNA gene Illumina sequencing indicated no major modification of bacterial diversity in the presence or absence of pesticides/metabolites, except for ESA-metolachlor and propiconazole at 10 μg/L that tended to increase or decrease Shannon and InvSimpson indices, respectively. General growth parameters suggested no impact of pesticides, except for propiconazole at 10 μg/L that partially inhibited acetate uptake and induced a decrease in microbial biomass. In conclusion, pesticides and metabolites can have side effects at environmental concentrations on microbial denitrification in groundwater and may thus affect ecosystem services based on microbial activities.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,"Metabarcoding, Metabolomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
448,2021,Reconstruction of ancient microbial genomes from the human gut,"Loss of gut microbial diversity1–6 in industrial populations is associated with chronic diseases7, underscoring the importance of studying our ancestral gut microbiome. However, relatively little is known about the composition of pre-industrial gut microbiomes. Here we performed a large-scale de novo assembly of microbial genomes from palaeofaeces. From eight authenticated human palaeofaeces samples (1,000–2,000 years old) with well-preserved DNA from southwestern USA and Mexico, we reconstructed 498 medium- and high-quality microbial genomes. Among the 181 genomes with the strongest evidence of being ancient and of human gut origin, 39% represent previously undescribed species-level genome bins. Tip dating suggests an approximate diversification timeline for the key human symbiont Methanobrevibacter smithii. In comparison to 789 present-day human gut microbiome samples from eight countries, the palaeofaeces samples are more similar to non-industrialized than industrialized human gut microbiomes. Functional profiling of the palaeofaeces samples reveals a markedly lower abundance of antibiotic-resistance and mucin-degrading genes, as well as enrichment of mobile genetic elements relative to industrial gut microbiomes. This study facilitates the discovery and characterization of previously undescribed gut microorganisms from ancient microbiomes and the investigation of the evolutionary history of the human gut microbiota through genome reconstruction from palaeofaeces. Ancient microbiomes from palaeofaeces are more similar to non-industrialized than industrialized human gut microbiomes regardless of geography, but 39% of their de novo reconstructed genomes represent previously undescribed microbial species.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, AMR, MAGs",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
449,2021,A surgical method for continuous intraportal infusion of gut microbial metabolites in mice,"Gut microbe–derived metabolites influence human physiology and disease. However, establishing mechanistic links between gut microbial metabolites and disease pathogenesis in animal models remains challenging. The major route of absorption for microbe-derived small molecules is venous drainage via the portal vein to the liver. In the event of presystemic hepatic metabolism, the route of metabolite administration becomes critical. To our knowledge, we describe here a novel portal vein cannulation technique using a s.c. implanted osmotic pump to achieve continuous portal vein infusion in mice. We first administered the microbial metabolite trimethylamine (TMA) over 4 weeks, during which increased peripheral plasma levels of TMA and its host liver-derived cometabolite, trimethylamine-N-oxide, were observed when compared with a vehicle control. Next, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4-HPAA), a microbial metabolite that undergoes extensive presystemic hepatic metabolism, was administered intraportally to examine effects on hepatic gene expression. As expected, hepatic levels of 4-HPAA were elevated when compared with the control group while peripheral plasma 4-HPAA levels remained the same. Moreover, significant changes in the hepatic transcriptome were revealed by an unbiased RNA-Seq approach. Collectively, to our knowledge this work describes a novel method for administering gut microbe–derived metabolites via the portal vein, mimicking their physiologic delivery in vivo.",Pathogen,,"(Meta)transcriptomics, Metabolomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
450,2021,Epidemiologic case investigation on the zoonotic transmission of Staphylococcus aureus infection from goat to veterinarians,"Staphylococcus aureus infection led to a case of goat abortion, and four veterinarians contracted S. aureus infection from the goat during and after the abortion. Three veterinarians assisted a doe during the dystocic delivery of a dead foetus. Seventy‐two hours after the dystocia, which ended with the goat's death, the veterinarians who assisted during the kidding and the veterinarian who performed the necropsy showed the presence of multiple, isolated, painful pustules 1–5 mm in diameter located along their forearms and knees. S. aureus was isolated from the pustules of the veterinarians, the placenta and uterus of the goat, the organs (brain, thymus gland, abomasum, liver and spleen) of the foetus, the scrotum and eye swabs of the buck, and mammary pustules of another goat from the same herd. Histological analysis revealed purulent metritis and inflammation of the placental cotyledons. Additional investigations eliminated the chances of other infections. S. aureus isolates recovered from the veterinarians, goats, foetus and buck were sensitive to the tested anti‐microbials and did not encode staphylococcal enterotoxin genes (sea, ser, sep, see, seg and sei). The isolates were closely related, as indicated by the results of Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy and comparative whole‐genome sequencing analysis. The results of this study clearly support the hypothesis that an episode of professional zoonosis was caused by S. aureus infection during the abortion and also highlight the need for bacterial subtyping in epidemiological surveys.",Bacteria,"Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, Comparative analysis",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease

We used whole-genome sequencing, rapid commercial molecular tests, laboratory-developed tests and routine culture testing. We identified the carriage of the metallo-β-lactamase blaVIM-2 and blaIMP-18 alleles in Carbapenem-Resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections among children in Costa Rica. The blaIMP-18 allele is not present in the most frequently used commercial tests; thus, it is possible that the circulation of this resistance gene may be underdiagnosed in Costa Rica.","Bacteria, Pathogen","Isolate, AMR",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease
452,2021,A Peek into the Plasmidome of Global Sewage,"This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study to investigate plasmidomes at a global scale using long read sequencing from complex untreated domestic sewage. Previous metagenomic surveys have detected AMR genes in a variety of environments, including sewage. ABSTRACT Plasmids can provide a selective advantage for microorganisms to survive and adapt to new environmental conditions. Plasmid-encoded traits, such as antimicrobial resistance (AMR) or virulence, impact the ecology and evolution of bacteria and can significantly influence the burden of infectious diseases. Insight about the identity and functions encoded on plasmids on the global scale are largely lacking. Here, we investigate the plasmidome of 24 samples (22 countries, 5 continents) from the global sewage surveillance project. We obtained 105-Gbp Oxford Nanopore and 167-Gbp Illumina NextSeq DNA sequences from plasmid DNA preparations and assembled 165,302 contigs (159,322 circular). Of these, 58,429 carried genes encoding for plasmid-related and 11,222 for virus/phage-related proteins. About 90% of the circular DNA elements did not have any similarity to known plasmids. Those that exhibited similarity had similarity to plasmids whose hosts were previously detected in these sewage samples (e.g., Acinetobacter, Escherichia, Moraxella, Enterobacter, Bacteroides, and Klebsiella). Some AMR classes were detected at a higher abundance in plasmidomes (e.g., macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B, macrolide, and quinolone) compared to the respective complex sewage samples. In addition to AMR genes, a range of functions were encoded on the candidate plasmids, including plasmid replication and maintenance, mobilization, and conjugation. In summary, we describe a laboratory and bioinformatics workflow for the recovery of plasmids and other potential extrachromosomal DNA elements from complex microbiomes. Moreover, the obtained data could provide further valuable insight into the ecology and evolution of microbiomes, knowledge about AMR transmission, and the discovery of novel functions. IMPORTANCE This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study to investigate plasmidomes at a global scale using long read sequencing from complex untreated domestic sewage. Previous metagenomic surveys have detected AMR genes in a variety of environments, including sewage. However, it is unknown whether the AMR genes were present on the microbial chromosome or located on extrachromosomal elements, such as plasmids. Using our approach, we recovered a large number of plasmids, of which most appear novel. We identified distinct AMR genes that were preferentially located on plasmids, potentially contributing to their transmissibility. Overall, plasmids are of great importance for the biology of microorganisms in their natural environments (free-living and host-associated), as well as for molecular biology and biotechnology. Plasmidome collections may therefore be valuable resources for the discovery of fundamental biological mechanisms and novel functions useful in a variety of contexts.","Bacteria, Virus, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, AMR","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
453,2021,Complementary Contribution of Fungi and Bacteria to Lignocellulose Digestion in the Food Stored by a Neotropical Higher Termite,"Lignocellulose digestion in termites is achieved through the functional synergy between gut symbionts and host enzymes. However, some species have evolved additional associations with nest microorganisms that collaborate in the decomposition of plant biomass. In a previous study, we determined that plant material packed with feces inside the nests of Cornitermes cumulans (Syntermitinae) harbors a distinct microbial assemblage. These food nodules also showed a high hemicellulolytic activity, possibly acting as an external place for complementary lignocellulose digestion. In this study, we used a combination of ITS sequence analysis, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics to investigate the presence and differential expression of genes coding for carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) in the food nodules and the gut of workers and soldiers. Our results confirm that food nodules express a distinct set of CAZy genes suggesting that stored plant material is initially decomposed by enzymes that target the lignin and complex polysaccharides from fungi and bacteria before the passage through the gut, where it is further targeted by a complementary set of cellulases, xylanases, and esterases produced by the gut microbiota and the termite host. We also showed that the expression of CAZy transcripts associated to endoglucanases and xylanases was higher in the gut of termites than in the food nodules. An additional finding in this study was the presence of fungi in the termite gut that expressed CAZy genes. This study highlights the importance of externalization of digestion by nest microbes and provides new evidence of complementary digestion in the context of higher termite evolution.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Functional analysis,"(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics, (Meta)transcriptomics, Metatranscriptomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

455,2021,Changes in Bacterial and Fungal Soil Communities in Long-Term Organic Cropping Systems,"Long-term organic farming aims to reduce synthetic fertilizer and pesticide use in order to sustainably produce and improve soil quality. To do this, there is a need for more information about the soil microbial community, which plays a key role in a sustainable agriculture. In this paper, we assessed the long-term effects of two organic and one conventional cropping systems on the soil microbial community structure using high-throughput sequencing analysis, as well as the link between these communities and the changes in the soil properties and crop yield. The results showed that the crop yield was similar among the three cropping systems. The microbial community changed according to cropping system. Organic cultivation with manure compost and compost tea (Org_C) showed a change in the bacterial community associated with an improved soil carbon and nutrient content. A linear discriminant analysis effect size showed different bacteria and fungi as key microorganisms for each of the three different cropping systems, for conventional systems (Conv), different microorganisms such as Nesterenkonia, Galbibacter, Gramella, Limnobacter, Pseudoalteromonas, Pantoe, and Sporobolomyces were associated with pesticides, while for Org_C and organic cultivation with manure (Org_M), other types of microorganisms were associated with organic amendments with different functions, which, in some cases, reduce soil borne pathogens. However, further investigations such as functional approaches or network analyses are need to better understand the mechanisms behind this behavior.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis",,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
456,2021,Heavy Metals in Soils and the Remediation Potential of Bacteria Associated With the Plant Microbiome,"High concentrations of non-essential heavy metals/metalloids (arsenic, cadmium, and lead) in soils and irrigation water represent a threat to the environment, food safety, and human and animal health. Microbial bioremediation has emerged as a promising strategy to reduce the concentration of heavy metals in the environment due to the demonstrated ability of microorganisms, especially bacteria, to sequester and transform these compounds. Although several bacterial strains have been reported to be capable of remediation of soils affected by heavy metals, published information has not been comprehensively analyzed to date to recommend the most efficient microbial resources for application in bioremediation or bacterial-assisted phytoremediation strategies that may help improve plant growth and yield in contaminated soils. In this study, we critically analyzed eighty-five research articles published over the past 15 years, focusing on bacteria-assisted remediation strategies for the non-essential heavy metals, arsenic, cadmium, and lead, and selected based on four criteria: i) The bacterial species studied are part of a plant microbiome, i.e., they interact closely with a plant species ii) these same bacterial species exhibit plant growth-promoting characteristics, iii) bacterial resistance to the metal(s) is expressed in terms of the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), and iv) metal resistance is related to biochemical or molecular mechanisms. A total of sixty-two bacterial genera, comprising 424 bacterial species/strains associated with fifty plant species were included in our analysis. Our results showed a close relationship between the tolerance level exhibited by the bacteria and metal identity, with lower MIC values found for cadmium and lead, while resistance to arsenic was widespread and significantly higher. In-depth analysis of the most commonly evaluated genera, Agrobacterium, Bacillus, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Microbacterium, Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus, and Mesorhizobium showed significantly different tolerance levels among them and highlighted the deployment of different biochemical and molecular mechanisms associated with plant growth promotion or with the presence of resistance genes located in the cad and ars operons. In particular, the genera Klebsiella and Enterobacter exhibited the highest levels of cadmium and lead tolerance, clearly supported by molecular and biochemical mechanisms; they were also able to mitigate plant growth inhibition under phytotoxic metal concentrations. These results position Klebsiella and Enterobacter as the best potential candidates for bioremediation and bacteria-assisted phytoremediation strategies in soils contaminated with arsenic, cadmium, and lead.","Bacteria, Microbiome",AMR,,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
457,2021,"Isolation and characterization of a novel bacteriophage, Kapi1, capable of O-antigen modification in commensal Escherichia coli","In this study, we describe the isolation and characterization of novel bacteriophage Kapi1 (vB_EcoP_Kapi1) isolated from a strain of commensal Escherichia coli inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract of healthy mice. We show that Kapi1 is a temperate phage integrated into tRNA argW of strain MP1 and describe its genome annotation and structure. Kapi1 shows limited homology to other characterized prophages but is most similar to the phages of Shigella flexneri, and clusters taxonomically with P22-like phages. Investigation of the lifestyle of Kapi1 shows that this phage displays unstable lysogeny and influences the growth of its host. The receptor for Kapi1 is the lipopolysaccharide O-antigen, and we further show that Kapi1 alters the structure of its hosts O-antigen in multiple ways. We hope to use MP1 and Kapi1 as a model system to explore molecular mechanisms of mammalian colonization by E. coli and ask what the role(s) of prophages in this context might be. Importance Although research exploring the microbiome has exploded in recent years, our understanding of the viral component of the microbiome is lagging far behind our understanding of the bacterial component. The vast majority of intestinal bacteria carry prophages integrated into their chromosomes, but most of these bacteriophages remain uncharacterized and unexplored. Here, we isolate and characterize a novel temperate bacteriophage infecting a commensal strain of Escherichia coli. We aim to explore the interactions between bacteriophages and their hosts in the context of the gastrointestinal tract, asking what role(s) temperate bacteriophage may play in growth and survival of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. Understanding the fundamental biology of commensal bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract can inform the development of novel antimicrobial or probiotic strategies for intestinal infections.","Bacteria, Virus, Microbiome","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, Interactome, AMR, Annotation",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease

459,2021,Mucin O-glycans suppress quorum sensing pathways and genetic transformation in Streptococcus mutans,"Mucus barriers accommodate trillions of microorganisms throughout the human body while preventing pathogenic colonization1. In the oral cavity, saliva containing the mucins MUC5B and MUC7 forms a pellicle that coats the soft tissue and teeth to prevent infection by oral pathogens, such as Streptococcus mutans2. Salivary mucin can interact directly with microorganisms through selective agglutinin activity and bacterial binding2–4, but the extent and basis of the protective functions of saliva are not well understood. Here, using an ex vivo saliva model, we identify that MUC5B is an inhibitor of microbial virulence. Specifically, we find that natively purified MUC5B downregulates the expression of quorum-sensing pathways activated by the competence stimulating peptide and the sigX-inducing peptide5. Furthermore, MUC5B prevents the acquisition of antimicrobial resistance through natural genetic transformation, a process that is activated through quorum sensing. Our data reveal that the effect of MUC5B is mediated by its associated O-linked glycans, which are potent suppressors of quorum sensing and genetic transformation, even when removed from the mucin backbone. Together, these results present mucin O-glycans as a host strategy for domesticating potentially pathogenic microorganisms without killing them. Salivary mucin-derived glycans downregulate genes of quorum-sensing systems associated with genetic competence, thereby suppressing the transformation of Streptococcus mutans.","Bacteria, Pathogen","Functional analysis, AMR",,Health & Disease
460,2021,Legume–microbiome interactions unlock mineral nutrients in regrowing tropical forests,"Significance Symbiotic dinitrogen (N2)-fixing trees fulfill a critical function in tropical forests by bringing in new nitrogen, yet it remains unclear how they overcome constraints by highly weathered, nutrient-poor tropical soils. We advance forest biogeochemistry and microbial ecology with the discovery from field trials in Panama that fast-growing N2-fixing trees in tropical forests exhibit accelerated mineral weathering and distinctive soil metagenomes that improve their access to inorganic nutrients in nutrient-poor soils. Furthermore, we show that N2-fixing trees exert similar effects on non-N2–fixing trees nearby thus having previously overlooked community-wide effects on tropical forest nutrient cycling. These results offer insights into the role of N2-fixing trees and their associated microbiomes in safeguarding the function of tropical forests within the global biosphere. Legume trees form an abundant and functionally important component of tropical forests worldwide with N2-fixing symbioses linked to enhanced growth and recruitment in early secondary succession. However, it remains unclear how N2-fixers meet the high demands for inorganic nutrients imposed by rapid biomass accumulation on nutrient-poor tropical soils. Here, we show that N2-fixing trees in secondary Neotropical forests triggered twofold higher in situ weathering of fresh primary silicates compared to non-N2–fixing trees and induced locally enhanced nutrient cycling by the soil microbiome community. Shotgun metagenomic data from weathered minerals support the role of enhanced nitrogen and carbon cycling in increasing acidity and weathering. Metagenomic and marker gene analyses further revealed increased microbial potential beneath N2-fixers for anaerobic iron reduction, a process regulating the pool of phosphorus bound to iron-bearing soil minerals. We find that the Fe(III)-reducing gene pool in soil is dominated by acidophilic Acidobacteria, including a highly abundant genus of previously undescribed bacteria, Candidatus Acidoferrum, genus novus. The resulting dependence of the Fe-cycling gene pool to pH determines the high iron-reducing potential encoded in the metagenome of the more acidic soils of N2-fixers and their nonfixing neighbors. We infer that by promoting the activities of a specialized local microbiome through changes in soil pH and C:N ratios, N2-fixing trees can influence the wider biogeochemical functioning of tropical forest ecosystems in a manner that enhances their ability to assimilate and store atmospheric carbon.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

Investigations of the intestinal microbiome in different species in a multiplicity of studies during recent decades have revealed differential microbial patterns and quantities along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Characterization of the microbial pattern in various aspects is a prerequisite for nutritional interventions. In this 16S rRNA amplicon-based approach, we present a characterization of the mucosa-associated microbiome in comparison with the luminal community of four infants at the time of the closure of ileostomies and perform a systematic characterization of the corresponding luminal and mucosal microbiome from jejunal, ileal and colonic regions, as well as collected feces in mice. The most dominant taxa in infant-derived samples altered due to individual differences, and in the mucosa, Enterococcus, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Veillonella, Streptococcus and Staphylococcus were the most abundant. Two less abundant taxa differed significantly between the mucosa and lumen. In murine samples, relative abundances differed significantly, mainly between the intestinal regions. Significant differences between mouse mucosa- and lumen-derived samples could be found in the observed species with a trend to lower estimated diversity in mucosa-derived samples, as well as in the relative abundance of individual taxa. In this study, we examined the difference between the mucosal and luminal bacterial colonization of the gastrointestinal tract in a small sample cohort of preterm infants. Individual differences were characterized and statistical significance was reached in two taxa (Cupriavidus, Ralstonia). The corresponding study on the different murine intestinal regions along the GI tract showed differences all over the intestinal region.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
463,2021,Validation strategy of a bioinformatics whole genome sequencing workflow for Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli using a reference collection extensively characterized with conventional methods,"Whole genome sequencing (WGS) enables complete characterization of bacterial pathogenic isolates at single nucleotide resolution, making it the ultimate tool for routine surveillance and outbreak investigation. The lack of standardization, and the variation regarding bioinformatics workflows and parameters, however, complicates interoperability among (inter)national laboratories. We present a validation strategy applied to a bioinformatics workflow for Illumina data that performs complete characterization of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) isolates including antimicrobial resistance prediction, virulence gene detection, serotype prediction, plasmid replicon detection and sequence typing. The workflow supports three commonly used bioinformatics approaches for the detection of genes and alleles: alignment with blast+, kmer-based read mapping with KMA, and direct read mapping with SRST2. A collection of 131 STEC isolates collected from food and human sources, extensively characterized with conventional molecular methods, was used as a validation dataset. Using a validation strategy specifically adopted to WGS, we demonstrated high performance with repeatability, reproducibility, accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity above 95 % for the majority of all assays. The WGS workflow is publicly available as a ‘push-button’ pipeline at https://galaxy.sciensano.be. Our validation strategy and accompanying reference dataset consisting of both conventional and WGS data can be used for characterizing the performance of various bioinformatics workflows and assays, facilitating interoperability between laboratories with different WGS and bioinformatics set-ups.","Bacteria, Pathogen","Isolate, AMR",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease
464,2021,Dysbiosis of Oral Microbiota During Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Development,"Infection with specific pathogens and alterations in tissue commensal microbial composition are intricately associated with the development of many human cancers. Likewise, dysbiosis of oral microbiome was also shown to play critical role in the initiation as well as progression of oral cancer. However, there are no reports portraying changes in oral microbial community in the patients of Indian subcontinent, which has the highest incidence of oral cancer per year, globally. To establish the association of bacterial dysbiosis and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) among the Indian population, malignant lesions and anatomically matched adjacent normal tissues were obtained from fifty well-differentiated OSCC patients and analyzed using 16S rRNA V3-V4 amplicon based sequencing on the MiSeq platform. Interestingly, in contrast to the previous studies, a significantly lower bacterial diversity was observed in the malignant samples as compared to the normal counterpart. Overall our study identified Prevotella, Corynebacterium, Pseudomonas, Deinococcus and Noviherbaspirillum as significantly enriched genera, whereas genera including Actinomyces, Sutterella, Stenotrophomonas, Anoxybacillus, and Serratia were notably decreased in the OSCC lesions. Moreover, we demonstrated HPV-16 but not HPV-18 was significantly associated with the OSCC development. In future, with additional validation, this panel could directly be applied into clinical diagnostic and prognostic workflows for OSCC in Indian scenario.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
465,2021,A single system detects and protects the beneficial oral bacterium Streptococcus sp. A12 from a spectrum of antimicrobial peptides,"The commensal bacterium Streptococcus sp. A12 has multiple properties that may promote the stability of health‐associated oral biofilms, including overt antagonism of the dental caries pathogen Streptococcus mutans. A LanFEG‐type ABC transporter, PcfFEG, confers tolerance to the lantibiotic nisin and enhances the ability of A12 to compete against S. mutans. Here, we investigated the regulation of pcfFEG and adjacent genes for a two‐component system, pcfRK, to better understand antimicrobial peptide resistance by A12. Induction of pcfFEG‐pcfRK was the primary mechanism to respond rapidly to nisin. In addition to nisin, PcfFEG conferred tolerance by A12 to a spectrum of lantibiotic and non‐lantibiotic antimicrobial peptides produced by a diverse collection of S. mutans isolates. Loss of PcfFEG resulted in the altered spatio‐temporal arrangement of A12 and S. mutans in a dual‐species biofilm model. Deletion of PcfFEG or PcfK resulted in constitutive activation of pcfFEG and expression of pcfFEG was inhibited by small peptides in the pcfK mutant. Transcriptional profiling of pcfR or pcfK mutants combined with functional genomics revealed peculiarities in PcfK function and a novel panel of genes responsive to nisin. Collectively, the results provide fundamental insights that strengthen the foundation for the design of microbial‐based therapeutics to control oral infectious diseases.","Bacteria, Pathogen","Isolate, Functional analysis, AMR",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
466,2021,Soil Disturbance Affects Plant Productivity via Soil Microbial Community Shifts,"Recent advances in climate research have discovered that permafrost is particularly vulnerable to the changes occurring in the atmosphere and climate, especially in Alaska where 85% of the land is underlain by mostly discontinuous permafrost. As permafrost thaws, research has shown that natural and anthropogenic soil disturbance causes microbial communities to undergo shifts in membership composition and biomass, as well as in functional diversity. Boreal forests are home to many plants that are integral to the subsistence diets of many Alaska Native communities. Yet, it is unclear how the observed shifts in soil microbes can affect above ground plant communities that are relied on as a major source of food. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that microbial communities associated with permafrost thaw affect plant productivity by growing five plant species found in Boreal forests and Tundra ecosystems, including low-bush cranberry and bog blueberry, with microbial communities from the active layer soils of a permafrost thaw gradient. We found that plant productivity was significantly affected by the microbial soil inoculants. Plants inoculated with communities from above thawing permafrost showed decreased productivity compared to plants inoculated with microbes from undisturbed soils. We used metagenomic sequencing to determine that microbial communities from disturbed soils above thawing permafrost differ in taxonomy from microbial communities in undisturbed soils above intact permafrost. The combination of these results indicates that a decrease in plant productivity can be linked to soil disturbance driven changes in microbial community membership and abundance. These data contribute to an understanding of how microbial communities can be affected by soil disturbance and climate change, and how those community shifts can further influence plant productivity in Boreal forests and more broadly, ecosystem health.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

468,2021,Molecular characterisation of the first New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase 1-producing Acinetobacter baumannii from Tanzania,"Abstract Background We aimed to characterise the genetic determinants and context of two meropenem-resistant clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from children hospitalised with bloodstream infections in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Methods Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by disc diffusion E-test and broth microdilution. Genomes were completed using a hybrid assembly of Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing reads and characterisation of the genetic context of resistance genes, multi-locus sequence types (STs) and phylogenetic analysis was determined bioinformatically. Results Twelve A. baumannii were isolated from 2226 blood cultures, two of which were meropenem-resistant. The two meropenem-resistant isolates, belonging to distinct STs, ST374 and ST239, were found to harbour blaNDM-1, which was chromosomally located in isolate DT0544 and plasmid-located in isolate DT01139. The genetic environment of blaNDM-1 shows the association of insertion sequence ISAba125 with blaNDM-1 in both isolates. Both isolates also harboured genes conferring resistance to other β-lactams, aminoglycosides and cotrimoxazole. Conclusions This is the first report of New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-producing isolates of A. baumannii from Tanzania. The genetic context of blaNDM-1 provides further evidence of the importance of ISAba125 in the spread of blaNDM-1 in A. baumannii. Local surveillance should be strengthened to keep clinicians updated on the incidence of these and other multidrug-resistant and difficult-to-treat bacteria.",Bacteria,"Isolate, AMR, MAGs",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
469,2021,Relative genetic diversity of the rare and endangered Agave shawii ssp. shawii and associated soil microbes within a southern California ecological preserve,"Abstract Shaw's Agave (Agave shawii ssp. shawii) is an endangered maritime succulent growing along the coast of California and northern Baja California. The population inhabiting Point Loma Peninsula has a complicated history of transplantation without documentation. The low effective population size in California prompted agave transplanting from the U.S. Naval Base site (NB) to Cabrillo National Monument (CNM). Since 2008, there are no agave sprouts identified on the CNM site, and concerns have been raised about the genetic diversity of this population. We sequenced two barcoding loci, rbcL and matK, of 27 individual plants from 5 geographically distinct populations, including 12 individuals from California (NB and CNM). Phylogenetic analysis revealed the three US and two Mexican agave populations are closely related and have similar genetic variation at the two barcoding regions, suggesting the Point Loma agave population is not clonal. Agave‐associated soil microbes used significantly more carbon sources in CNM soil samples than in NB soil likely due to higher pH and moisture content; meanwhile, soil type and soil chemistry analysis including phosphorus, nitrate nitrogen, organic matter, and metals revealed significant correlations between microbial diversity and base saturation (p < 0.05, r 2 = 0.3676), lime buffer capacity (p < 0.01, r 2 = 0.7055), equilibrium lime buffer capacity (p < 0.01, r 2 = 0.7142), and zinc (p < 0.01, r 2 = 0.7136). Soil microbiome analysis within the CNM population revealed overall expected richness (H′ = 5.647–6.982) for Agave species, while the diversity range (1 − D = 0.003392–0.014108) suggests relatively low diversity marked by high individual variation. The most prominent remaining US population of this rare species is not clonal and does not seem to be threatened by a lack of genetic and microbial diversity. These results prompt further efforts to investigate factors affecting Agave's reproduction and fitness.",Microbiome,Community (taxonomy) profiling,,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
470,2021,"Comparison of rectal swab, glove tip, and participant-collected stool techniques for gut microbiome sampling","Background Studies of the gut microbiome are becoming increasingly important. Such studies require stool collections that can be processed or frozen in a timely manner so as not to alter the microbial content. Due to the logistical difficulties of home-based stool collection, there has been a challenge in selecting the appropriate sample collection technique and comparing results from different microbiome studies. Thus, we compared stool collection and two alternative clinic-based fecal microbiome collection techniques, including a newer glove-based collection method. Results We prospectively enrolled 22 adult men from our prostate cancer screening cohort SABOR (San Antonio Biomarkers of Risk for prostate cancer) in San Antonio, TX, from 8/2018 to 4/2019. A rectal swab and glove tip sample were collected from each participant during a one-time visit to our clinics. A single stool sample was collected at the participant’s home. DNA was isolated from the fecal material and 16 s rRNA sequencing of the V1-V2 and V3-V4 regions was performed. We found the gut microbiome to be similar in richness and evenness, noting no differences in alpha diversity among the collection methods. The stool collection method, which remains the gold-standard method for the gut microbiome, proved to have different community composition compared to swab and glove tip techniques ( p < 0.001) as measured by Bray-Curtis and unifrac distances. There were no significant differences in between the swab and glove tip samples with regard to beta diversity ( p > 0.05). Despite differences between home-based stool and office-based fecal collection methods, we noted that the distance metrics for the three methods cluster by participant indicating within-person similarities. Additionally, no taxa differed among the methods in a Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) analysis comparing all-against-all sampling methods. Conclusion The glove tip method provides similar gut microbiome results as rectal swab and stool microbiome collection techniques. The addition of a new office-based collection technique could help easy and practical implementation of gut microbiome research studies and clinical practice.",Microbiome,"Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, Gene identification / Biomarker",,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
471,2021,Allopatric divergence limits cheating range and alters genetic requirements for a cooperative trait,"Social and genomic context may constrain the fates of mutations in cooperation genes. While some mechanisms limiting cheaters evolve in the presence of cheating, here we ask whether cheater resistance can evolve latently even in environments where cooperation is not expressed and cheaters are absent. The bacteriumMyxococcus xanthusundergoes cooperative multicellular development upon starvation, but developmentally defective cheaters can outcompete cooperators within mixed groups. Using natural isolates and an obligate cheater disrupted at the developmental-signaling genecsgA, we show that cheating range is narrow among natural strains due to antagonisms that do not specifically target cheaters. Further, we mixed the cheater with closely related cooperators that diverged from it allopatrically in nutrient-rich environments in which cooperative development does not occur, showing that even slight divergence under these conditions can eliminate cheating phenotypes. Our results suggest that such cooperation- and cheater-blind divergence can generate a geographic mosaic of local cheater-cooperator compatibility patches that limit cheater spread. We also ask whether genomic divergence can shape the fitness effects of disrupting a cooperation gene. Construction of the samecsgAmutation in several natural-isolate cooperators generated a wide range of pure-culture sporulation phenotypes, from a complete defect to no defect. Thus, we find that epistatic interactions limit the range of genomes within which a mutation creates a cooperation defect. Moreover, these results reveal Developmental System Drift in a microbial system because sporulation proficiency is conserved across the natural isolates despite divergence in the role ofcsgA.Selection on cooperators exploited by obligate cheaters can induce evolution of resistance to cheating. Here we show that cooperators can also rapidly evolve immunity to cheating simply as a byproduct of evolutionary divergence in environments in which cooperation and cheating at the focal trait do not occur because the trait is not expressed. We also find that differences in the genomic context in which a cooperation-gene mutation arises can profoundly alter its phenotypic effect and determine whether the mutation generates a social defect at all - a pre-requisite for obligate cheating. These findings suggest that general divergence of social populations under a broad range of environmental conditions can restrict both the set of mutations that might generate social defectors in the first place and the host range of such defectors once they arise.",Bacteria,"Isolate, Interactome, AMR",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
472,2021,Challenge of Bovine Foot Skin Fibroblasts With Digital Dermatitis Treponemes Identifies Distinct Pathogenic Mechanisms,"Bovine digital dermatitis (BDD) is a common infectious disease of digital skin in cattle and an important cause of lameness worldwide, with limited treatment options. It is of increasing global concern for both animal welfare and food security, imposing a large economic burden on cattle farming industries each year. A polytreponemal etiology has been consistently identified, with three key phylogroups implicated globally: Treponema medium, Treponema phagedenis, and Treponema pedis. Pathogenic mechanisms which might enable targeted treatment/therapeutic development are poorly defined. This study used RNA sequencing to determine global differential mRNA expression in primary bovine foot skin fibroblasts following challenge with three representative BDD treponemes and a commensal treponeme, Treponema ruminis. A pro-inflammatory response was elicited by the BDD treponemes, mediated through IL-8/IL-17 signaling. Unexpectedly, the three BDD treponemes elicited distinct mechanisms of pathogenesis. T. phagedenis and T. pedis increased abundance of mRNA transcripts associated with apoptosis, while T. medium and T. pedis increased transcripts involved in actin rearrangement and loss of cell adhesion, likely promoting tissue invasion. The upregulation of antimicrobial peptide precursor, DEFB123, by T. phagedenis spirochaetes may present a microbial ecological advantage to all treponemes within BDD infected tissue, explaining their dominance within lesions. A commensal, T. ruminis, significantly dysregulated over three times the number of host mRNA transcripts compared to BDD treponemes, implying BDD treponemes, akin to the syphilis pathogen (Treponema pallidum), have evolved as “stealth pathogens” which avoid triggering substantial host immune/inflammatory responses to enable persistence and tissue invasion. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated increased IL-6, IL-8, RND1, and CFB protein expression in BDD lesions, confirming in vitro fibroblast observations and highlighting the system’s value in modeling BDD pathogenesis. Several unique shared gene targets were identified, particularly RGS16, GRO1, MAFF, and ZC3H12A. The three key BDD Treponema phylogroups elicited both distinct and shared pathogenic mechanisms in bovine foot skin; upregulating inflammation whilst simultaneously suppressing adaptive immunity. The novel gene targets identified here should enable future vaccine/therapeutic approaches.","Virus, Pathogen",AMR,,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
473,2021,Selective targeting of dipeptidyl‐peptidase 4 (DPP‐4) positive senescent chondrocyte ameliorates osteoarthritis progression,"Obesity, metabolic disease and some psychiatric conditions are associated with changes to relative abundance of bacterial species and specific genes in the faecal microbiome. Little is known about the impact of pharmacologically induced weight loss on distinct microbiome species and their respective gene programs in obese individuals. Using shotgun metagenomics, the composition of the microbiome was obtained for two cohorts of obese female Wistar rats (n = 10–12, total of 82) maintained on a high fat diet before and after a 42-day treatment with a panel of four investigatory or approved anti-obesity drugs (tacrolimus/FK506, bupropion, naltrexone and sibutramine), alone or in combination. Only sibutramine treatment induced consistent weight loss and improved glycaemic control in the obese rats. Weight loss was associated with reduced food intake and changes to the faecal microbiome in multiple microbial taxa, genes, and pathways. These include increased β-diversity, increased relative abundance of multiple Bacteroides species, increased Bacteroides/Firmicutes ratio and changes to abundance of genes and species associated with obesity-induced inflammation, particularly those encoding components of the flagellum and its assembly. Sibutramine-induced weight loss in obese rats is associated with improved metabolic health, and changes to the faecal microbiome consistent with a reduction in obesity-induced bacterially-driven inflammation.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, MAGs","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

475,2020,Gut Microbial Dysbiosis and Plasma Metabolic Profile in Individuals With Vitiligo,"Autoimmune diseases are increasingly linked to aberrant gut microbiome and relevant metabolites. However, the association between vitiligo and the gut microbiome remains to be elucidated. Thus, we conducted a case-control study through 16S rRNA sequencing and serum untargeted-metabolomic profiling based on 30 vitiligo patients and 30 matched healthy controls. In vitiligo patients, the microbial composition was distinct from that of healthy controls according to the analysis on α- and β-diversity (P < 0.05), with a characteristic decreased Bacteroidetes: Firmicutes ratio. Meanwhile, the levels of 23 serum metabolites (including taurochenodeoxycholate and L-NG-monomethyl-arginine) in the vitiligo patients were different from those in the healthy individuals and showed significant correlations with some microbial markers. We found that Corynebacterium 1, Ruminococcus 2, Jeotgalibaca and Psychrobacter were correlated significantly with disease duration and serum IL-1β level in vitiligo patients. And Psychrobacter was identified as the most predictive features for vitiligo by machine learning analysis (“importance” = 0.0236). Finally, combining multi-omics data and joint prediction models with accuracies up to 0.929 were established with dominant contribution of Corynebacterium 1 and Psychrobacter. Our findings replenished the previously unknown relationship between gut dysbiosis and vitiligo circulating metabolome and enrolled the gut-skin axis into the understanding of vitiligo pathogenesis.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen",Community (taxonomy) profiling,"Metabarcoding, Metabolomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
476,2020,Microbial community composition in the rhizosphere of Larix decidua under different light regimes with additional focus on methane cycling microorganisms,"Microbial community and diversity in the rhizosphere is strongly influenced by biotic and/or abiotic factors, like root exudates, nutrient availability, edaphon and climate. Here we report on the microbial diversity within the rhizosphere of Larix decidua, a dominant tree species in the Alps, as compared with the microbiome within the surrounding soil. We describe how increased light intensity influenced the rhizobiome and put emphasize on methane cycling microorganisms. Microbial taxa were classified into 26 bacterial, 4 archaeal and 6 fungal phyla revealing significant differences between bulk and rhizosphere soils. The dominant prokaryotic phyla were Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria (both, rhizosphere and bulk soil) and Bacteroidetes (rhizosphere soil only) and dominant fungal phyla in both fractions included Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. The rhizosphere community was indicated by Suillus sp., plant growth-promoting bacteria and Candidatus Saccharibacteria. Predicted genes in membrane transport and carbohydrate metabolism were significantly more abundant in rhizosphere soils while genes connected with energy metabolisms and cell motility increased in bulk soils. Dominant methanotrophic microorganisms were Upland Soil Cluster (USC) α methanotrophs, Methylogaea spp. and Methylosinus spp., while most methanogens belonged to Methanomassiliicoccales. The overall abundance of methanotrophs distinctly increased in the rhizosphere but to a very different species-specific extent. The increased light intensity only led to minor changes in the rhizobiome, nevertheless a couple of indicator species (e.g. Pseudomonas sp.) for intensified light conditions were established.","Bacteria, Archaea, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
477,2020,New Frontiers of Anaerobic Hydrocarbon Biodegradation in the Multi-Omics Era,"The accumulation of petroleum hydrocarbons in the environment substantially endangers terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Many microbial strains have been recognized to utilize aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons under aerobic conditions. Nevertheless, most of these pollutants are transferred by natural processes, including rain, into the underground anaerobic zones where their degradation is much more problematic. In oxic zones, anaerobic microenvironments can be formed as a consequence of the intensive respiratory activities of (facultative) aerobic microbes. Even though aerobic bioremediation has been well-characterized over the past few decades, ample research is yet to be done in the field of anaerobic hydrocarbon biodegradation. With the emergence of high-throughput techniques, known as omics (e.g., genomics and metagenomics), the individual biodegraders, hydrocarbon-degrading microbial communities and metabolic pathways, interactions can be described at a contaminated site. Omics approaches provide the opportunity to examine single microorganisms or microbial communities at the system level and elucidate the metabolic networks, interspecies interactions during hydrocarbon mineralization. Metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics, for example, can shed light on the active genes and proteins and functional importance of the less abundant species. Moreover, novel unculturable hydrocarbon-degrading strains and enzymes can be discovered and fit into the metabolic networks of the community. Our objective is to review the anaerobic hydrocarbon biodegradation processes, the most important hydrocarbon degraders and their diverse metabolic pathways, including the use of various terminal electron acceptors and various electron transfer processes. The review primarily focuses on the achievements obtained by the current high-throughput (multi-omics) techniques which opened new perspectives in understanding the processes at the system level including the metabolic routes of individual strains, metabolic/electric interaction of the members of microbial communities. Based on the multi-omics techniques, novel metabolic blocks can be designed and used for the construction of microbial strains/consortia for efficient removal of hydrocarbons in anaerobic zones.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics, (Meta)transcriptomics, Metatranscriptomics, (Meta)proteomics, Metaproteomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
478,2020,Investigation of Two Mycobacterium abscessus Outbreaks in Quebec Using Whole Genome Sequencing,"In recent decades, nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infections are of emerging public health concern and have contributed towards significant clinical and economic burden globally. One such rapid growing mycobacteria, Mycobacterium abscessus, can cause clonal outbreaks, and these bacteria exhibit a highly resistant antimicrobial susceptibility profile. Here, we present an investigation of two small outbreaks of M. abscessus: first in a pediatric clinic setting and second in a tattoo parlour from Quebec. Two whole genome sequencing approaches were utilized for genotyping: MAB-MLST, a multilocus sequencing typing scheme containing housekeeping, identification, and antimicrobial resistance genes, and SNVPhyl that uses phylogenetics to determine single nucleotide variations between strains. MAB-MLST results showed that the pediatric outbreak strains had two distinct sequence types, demonstrating that one strain did not belong to the outbreak, while all tattoo outbreak isolates belonged to the same sequence type. SNVPhyl results were similar to MAB-MLST results and showed that the pediatric outbreak strains tightly clustered together with 0-1 SNVs between isolates, a sharp contrast between unrelated strains used as controls. Similar results were seen for tattoo outbreak cases with 3-11 SNVs between isolates. NTM infections can be difficult to identify, and outbreak investigations can be complicated. Thus, WGS tools can be used in public health outbreak investigations as they provide high discriminatory power.",Bacteria,"Isolate, AMR, (M)LST",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease

We examined the relationship between the vaginal microbiota and persistent hrHPV infection in HIV-negative and HIV-positive women. We used 16S-rRNA sequencing to characterize the vaginal microbiota of two serial samples taken six months apart from 211 Nigerian women (67%, 142/211 HIV-positive and 33%, 69/211 HIV-negative) and evaluated the association between the vaginal microbiota and persistent hrHPV infection using generalized estimating equation logistic regression models and linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) algorithm to identify phylotypic biomarkers of persistent hrHPV infection. The high diversity microbiota, Community State Type IV-B, was the most prevalent in both HIV-negative (38% at baseline, 30% at the follow-up visit) and HIV-positive (27% at baseline, 35% at the follow-up visit) women. The relationship between the vaginal microbiota and persistent hrHPV was modified by HIV status. In HIV-negative women, women with Lactobacillus dominant microbiota had lower odds (OR: 0.35, 95% CI 0.14–0.89, p = 0.03) of persistent hrHPV compared to women with Lactobacillus deficient microbiota. While among HIV-positive women, the odds of being persistently infected with hrHPV was higher in women with Lactobacillus dominant microbiota (OR: 1.25, 95% CI 0.73–2.14 p = 0.41). This difference in effect estimates by HIV was statistically significant (p = 0.02). A high diversity vaginal microbial community with paucity of Lactobacillus species was associated with persistent hrHPV infection in HIV-negative women but not in HIV-positive women.","Virus, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Gene identification / Biomarker",Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
480,2020,Colonization of Naive Roots from Populus tremula × alba Involves Successive Waves of Fungi and Bacteria with Different Trophic Abilities,"The tree root microbiome is composed of a very diverse set of bacterial and fungal communities. These microorganisms have a profound impact on tree growth, development, and protection against different types of stress. ABSTRACT Through their roots, trees interact with a highly complex community of microorganisms belonging to various trophic guilds and contributing to tree nutrition, development, and protection against stresses. Tree roots select for specific microbial species from the bulk soil communities. The root microbiome formation is a dynamic process, but little is known on how the different microorganisms colonize the roots and how the selection occurs. To decipher whether the final composition of the root microbiome is the product of several waves of colonization by different guilds of microorganisms, we planted sterile rooted cuttings of gray poplar obtained from plantlets propagated in axenic conditions in natural poplar stand soil. We analyzed the root microbiome at different time points between 2 and 50 days of culture by combining high-throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the fungal ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer and bacterial 16S rRNA amplicons with confocal laser scanning microscopy observations. The microbial colonization of poplar roots took place in three stages, but bacteria and fungi had different dynamics. Root bacterial communities were clearly different from those in the soil after 2 days of culture. In contrast, if fungi were also already colonizing roots after 2 days, the initial communities were very close to that in the soil and were dominated by saprotrophs. They were slowly replaced by endophytes and ectomycorhizal fungi. The replacement of the most abundant fungal and bacterial community members observed in poplar roots over time suggest potential competition effect between microorganisms and/or a selection by the host. IMPORTANCE The tree root microbiome is composed of a very diverse set of bacterial and fungal communities. These microorganisms have a profound impact on tree growth, development, and protection against different types of stress. They mainly originate from the bulk soil and colonize the root system, which provides a unique nutrient-rich environment for a diverse assemblage of microbial communities. In order to better understand how the tree root microbiome is shaped over time, we observed the composition of root-associated microbial communities of naive plantlets of poplar transferred in natural soil. The composition of the final root microbiome relies on a series of colonization stages characterized by the dominance of different fungal guilds and bacterial community members over time. Our observations suggest an early stabilization of bacterial communities, whereas fungal communities are established following a more gradual pattern.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
481,2020,Genotypic and Phenotypic Characterization of Incompatibility Group FIB Positive Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium Isolates from Food Animal Sources,"Salmonella enterica is one of the most common bacterial foodborne pathogens in the United States, causing illnesses that range from self-limiting gastroenteritis to more severe, life threatening invasive disease. Many Salmonella strains contain plasmids that carry virulence, antimicrobial resistance, and/or transfer genes which allow them to adapt to diverse environments, and these can include incompatibility group (Inc) FIB plasmids. This study was undertaken to evaluate the genomic and phenotypic characteristics of IncFIB-positive Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium isolates from food animal sources, to identify their plasmid content, assess antimicrobial resistance and virulence properties, and compare their genotypic isolates with more recently isolated S. Typhimurium isolates from food animal sources. Methods: We identified 71 S. Typhimurium isolates that carried IncFIB plasmids. These isolates were subjected to whole genome sequencing and evaluated for bacteriocin production, antimicrobial susceptibility, the ability to transfer resistance plasmids, and a subset was evaluated for their ability to invade and persist in intestinal human epithelial cells. Results: Approximately 30% of isolates (n = 21) displayed bacteriocin inhibition of Escherichia coli strain J53. Bioinformatic analyses using PlasmidFinder software confirmed that all isolates contained IncFIB plasmids along with multiple other plasmid replicon types. Comparative analyses showed that all strains carried multiple antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence factors including iron acquisition genes, such as iucABCD (75%), iutA (94%), sitABCD (76%) and sitAB (100%). In 17 cases (71%), IncFIB plasmids, along with other plasmid replicon types, were able to conjugally transfer antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes to the susceptible recipient strain. For ten strains, persistence cell counts (27%) were noted to be significantly higher than invasion bacterial cell counts. When the genome sequences of the study isolates collected from 1998–2003 were compared to those published from subsequent years (2005–2018), overlapping genotypes were found, indicating the perseverance of IncFIB positive strains in food animal populations. This study confirms that IncFIB plasmids can play a potential role in disseminating antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes amongst bacteria from several food animal species.","Bacteria, Pathogen","Isolate, AMR, Comparative analysis",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

483,2020,A Novel Surgical Method for Continuous Intra-Portal Infusion of Gut Microbial Metabolites in Mice,"Gut microbial-derived metabolites have been shown to play key roles in human physiology and disease. However, establishing mechanistic links between gut microbial metabolites and disease pathogenesis in animal models presents many challenges. The major route of absorption for microbe-derived small molecules is venous drainage via the portal vein to the liver. In the event of extensive liver first pass- or presystemic hepatic metabolism, the route of administration of these metabolites becomes critical. Here we describe a novel portal vein cannulation technique using a subcutaneously implanted osmotic pump to achieve continuous portal vein infusion in mice. First, the microbial metabolite trimethylamine (TMA) was administered over 4 weeks and compared to a vehicle control. Using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), an increase in peripheral plasma levels of TMA and its host liver-derived co-metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) were observed in a sexually-dimorphic manner. Next, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4-HPAA), a structurally distinct microbial metabolite that undergoes extensive hepatic first pass metabolism, was administered intraportally to examine effects on hepatic gene expression. As expected, there was no difference in peripheral plasma 4-HPAA levels yet liver tissue demonstrated higher levels of 4-HPAA when compared to the control group. More importantly, significant changes were observed in hepatic gene expression using an unbiased RNA sequencing approach. Collectively, this work describes a novel method for administering gut microbe-derived metabolites via the portal vein, mimicking their physiologic delivery in vivo. Importance Recent efforts have underscored the importance of the gut microbial community as a meta-endocrine organ impacting host physiology through systemic delivery of gut-microbial metabolites [Brown and Hazen, 2015]. Microbial metabolites are first delivered to the liver via the portal vein following venous drainage of the gastrointestinal tract. This route of absorption is often crucial by allowing the liver to biotransfrom these molecules prior to entering the peripheral circulation. Microbial metabolites are frequently studied in animal models by incorporation into diet or drinking water. This method falls short as inconsistent oral intake, inconsistent gastrointestinal absorption, and further modification of the metabolite by gut microbes yield imprecise levels of drug delivery. In efforts to overcome this, the physiological impact of microbial metabolites is often studied by intermittent exogenous administration of a metabolite in a non-physiologically relevant manner such as intravenous injection, intraperitoneal injection, or subcutaneous administration, all placing a relatively large proportion of the metabolite directly into the peripheral circulation. Although these approaches can effectively raise circulating metabolites levels in some cases, they do not mimic the natural delivery of gut microbial-derived small molecules through the portal circulation to the liver. Here we describe a novel surgical method to continuously deliver precise amounts of gut microbial metabolites intraportally to better recapitulate the natural systemic delivery route of microbial metabolites to the liver. This model will improve the interrogation of gut microbial metabolites and their associations to disease by providing an unmatched level of resolution when manipulating the portal blood metabolome.","Microbiome, Pathogen",Community (taxonomy) profiling,"(Meta)proteomics, Metabolomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
484,2020,High prevalence of mcr-1-encoded colistin resistance in commensal Escherichia coli from broiler chicken in Bangladesh,"Colistin is a last-resort antimicrobial used for the treatment of human infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. However, colistin is still widely used in intensive poultry production in Bangladesh. We aimed to investigate the dynamics and genetic diversity of colistin-resistant commensal Escherichia coli from broiler chickens. A total of 1200 E. coli strains were characterized from 20 broiler farms at three-time points along the production period. All strains were screened for mcr-1 to mcr-5 genes by a multiplex PCR, and their genetic diversity was measured by repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP)-PCR fingerprinting. Genomic diversity and characterization were performed by whole genome sequencing (WGS). Twenty-five percent of the commensal E. coli strains harbored mcr-1 genes. Frequency of mcr-1 gene detection correlated positively (odds ratio 1.71; 95% CI 0.96–3.06; p = 0.068) with the use of colistin in poultry flocks. REP-PCR profiles and WGS analysis showed diverse E. coli population carrying multiple antimicrobial resistance genes. Phylogenetic comparison of mcr-1-bearing strains recovered from this study with a global strain collection revealed wide phylogenetic relationship. This study identified a high prevalence of mcr-1 gene among genetically diverse E. coli populations from broiler chickens in Bangladesh suggesting a massive horizontal spread of mcr-1 rather than by clonal expansion.",Bacteria,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
485,2020,The invasive red-eared slider turtle is more successful than the native Chinese three-keeled pond turtle: evidence from the gut microbiota,"Background The mutualistic symbiosis between the gut microbial communities (microbiota) and their host animals has attracted much attention. Many factors potentially affect the gut microbiota, which also varies among host animals. The native Chinese three-keeled pond turtle (Chinemys reevesii) and the invasive red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans) are two common farm-raised species in China, with the latter generally considered a more successful species. However, supporting evidence from the gut microbiota has yet to be collected. Methods We collected feces samples from these two turtle species raised in a farm under identical conditions, and analyzed the composition and relative abundance of the gut microbes using bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing on the Roach/454 platform. Results The gut microbiota was mainly composed of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes at the phylum level, and Porphyromonadaceae, Bacteroidaceae and Lachnospiraceae at the family level in both species. The relative abundance of the microbes and gene functions in the gut microbiota differed between the two species, whereas alpha or beta diversity did not. Microbes of the families Bacteroidaceae, Clostridiaceae and Lachnospiraceae were comparatively more abundant in C. reevesii, whereas those of the families Porphyromonadaceae and Fusobacteriaceae were comparatively more abundant in T. s. elegans. In both species the gut microbiota had functional roles in enhancing metabolism, genetic information processing and environmental information processing according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database. The potential to gain mass is greater in T. s. elegans than in C. reevesii, as revealed by the fact that the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was lower in the former species. The percentage of human disease-related functional genes was lower in T. s. elegans than in C. reevesii, presumably suggesting an enhanced potential to colonize new habitats in the former species.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Comparative analysis","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
486,2020,Genetic Determinants of Resistance to Extended-Spectrum Cephalosporin and Fluoroquinolone in Escherichia coli Isolated from Diseased Pigs in the United States,"Understanding the genetic mechanisms conferring resistance is critical to design informed control and preventive measures, particularly when involving critically important antimicrobial classes such as extended-spectrum cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. The genetic determinants of extended-spectrum cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone resistance were highly diverse, with multiple plasmids, insertion sequences, and genes playing key roles in mediating resistance in swine Escherichia coli. Plasmids assembled in this study are known to be disseminated globally in both human and animal populations and environmental samples, and E. coli in pigs might be part of a global reservoir of key antimicrobial resistance (AMR) elements. Virulent plasmids found in this study have been shown to confer fitness advantages to pathogenic E. coli strains. The presence of international, high-risk zoonotic clones provides worrisome evidence that resistance in swine isolates may have indirect public health implications, and the swine population as a reservoir for these high-risk clones should be continuously monitored. ABSTRACT Fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins are critically important antimicrobial classes for both human and veterinary medicine. We previously found a drastic increase in enrofloxacin resistance in clinical Escherichia coli isolates collected from diseased pigs from the United States over 10 years (2006 to 2016). However, the genetic determinants responsible for this increase have yet to be determined. The aim of the present study was to identify and characterize the genetic basis of resistance against fluoroquinolones (enrofloxacin) and extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ceftiofur) in swine E. coli isolates using whole-genome sequencing (WGS). blaCMY-2 (carried by IncA/C2, IncI1, and IncI2 plasmids), blaCTX-M (carried by IncF, IncHI2, and IncN plasmids), and blaSHV-12 (carried by IncHI2 plasmids) genes were present in 87 (82.1%), 19 (17.9%), and 3 (2.83%) of the 106 ceftiofur-resistant isolates, respectively. Of the 110 enrofloxacin-resistant isolates, 90 (81.8%) had chromosomal mutations in gyrA, gyrB, parA, and parC genes. Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes [qnrB77, qnrB2, qnrS1, qnrS2, and aac-(6)-lb′-cr] borne on ColE, IncQ2, IncN, IncF, and IncHI2 plasmids were present in 24 (21.8%) of the enrofloxacin-resistant isolates. Virulent IncF plasmids present in swine E. coli isolates were highly similar to epidemic plasmids identified globally. High-risk E. coli clones, such as ST744, ST457, ST131, ST69, ST10, ST73, ST410, ST12, ST127, ST167, ST58, ST88, ST617, ST23, etc., were also found in the U.S. swine population. Additionally, the colistin resistance gene (mcr-9) was present in several isolates. This study adds valuable information regarding resistance to critical antimicrobials with implications for both animal and human health. IMPORTANCE Understanding the genetic mechanisms conferring resistance is critical to design informed control and preventive measures, particularly when involving critically important antimicrobial classes such as extended-spectrum cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. The genetic determinants of extended-spectrum cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone resistance were highly diverse, with multiple plasmids, insertion sequences, and genes playing key roles in mediating resistance in swine Escherichia coli.

487,2020,Microbial Niche Diversification in the Galápagos Archipelago and Its Response to El Niño,"The Galápagos Archipelago is located at the intersection of several major oceanographic features that produce diverse environmental conditions around the islands, and thus has the potential to serve as a natural laboratory for discerning the underlying environmental factors that structure marine microbial communities. Here we used quantitative metagenomics to characterize microbial communities in relation to archipelago marine habitats, and how those populations shift due to substantial environmental changes brought on by El Niño. Environmental conditions such as temperature, salinity, inorganic dissolved nutrients, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations varied throughout the archipelago, revealing a diversity of potential microbial niches arising from upwelling, oligotrophic to eutrophic gradients, physical isolation, and potential island mass effects. The volumetric abundances of microbial community members shifted with these environmental changes and revealed several taxonomic indicators of different water masses. This included a transition from a Synechococcus dominated system in the west to an even mix of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus in the east, mirroring the archipelago’s mesotrophic to oligotrophic and productivity gradients. Several flavobacteria groups displayed characteristic habitat distributions, including enrichment of Polaribacter and Tenacibaculum clades in the relatively nutrient rich western waters, Leeuwenhoekiella spp. that were enriched in the more nutrient-deplete central and eastern sites, and the streamlined MS024-2A group found to be abundant across all sites. During the 2015/16 El Niño event, both environmental conditions and microbial community composition were substantially altered, primarily on the western side of the archipelago due to the reduction of upwelling from the Equatorial Undercurrent. When the upwelling resumed, concentrations of inorganic nutrients and DOC at the western surface sites were more typical of mesopelagic depths. Correspondingly, Synechococcus abundances decreased by an order of magnitude, while groups associated with deeper water masses were enriched, including streamlined roseobacters HTCC2255 and HIMB11, Thioglobacaceae, methylotrophs (Methylophilaceae), archaea (Nitrosopumilaceae), and distinct subpopulations of Pelagibaceriales (SAR11 clade). These results provide a quantitative framework to connect community-wide microbial volumetric abundances to their environmental drivers, and thus incorporation into biogeochemical and ecological models.","Bacteria, Archaea, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,"(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
488,2020,Soil disturbance affects plant growth via soil microbial community shifts,"Recent advances in climate research have discovered that permafrost is particularly vulnerable to the changes occurring in the atmosphere and climate, especially in Alaska where 85% of the land is underlain by mostly discontinuous permafrost. As permafrost thaws, research has shown that natural and anthropogenic soil disturbance causes microbial communities to undergo shifts in membership composition and biomass, as well as in functional diversity. Boreal forests are home to many plants that are integral to the subsistence diets of many Alaska Native communities. Yet, it is unclear how the observed shifts in soil microbes can affect above ground plant communities that are relied on as a major source of food. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that microbial communities associated with permafrost thaw affect plant growth by growing five plant species found in Boreal forests and Tundra ecosystems, including low-bush cranberry and bog blueberry, with microbial communities from the active layer soils of a permafrost thaw gradient. We found that plant growth was significantly affected by the microbial soil inoculants. Plants inoculated with communities from above thawing permafrost showed decreased growth compared to plants inoculated with microbes from undisturbed soils. We used metagenomic sequencing to determine that microbial communities from disturbed soils above thawing permafrost have differences in taxonomy from microbial communities in undisturbed soils above intact permafrost. The combination of these results indicates that a decrease in plant growth can be linked to soil disturbance driven changes in microbial community membership and abundance. These data contribute to an understanding of how microbial communities can be affected by soil disturbance and climate change, and how those community shifts can further influence plant growth in Boreal forests and more broadly, ecosystem health.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
489,2020,Rational design of a microbial consortium of mucosal sugar utilizers reduces Clostridiodes difficile colonization,"Many intestinal pathogens, including Clostridioides difficile, use mucus-derived sugars as crucial nutrients in the gut. Commensals that compete with pathogens for such nutrients are therefore ecological gatekeepers in healthy guts, and are attractive candidates for therapeutic interventions. Nevertheless, there is a poor understanding of which commensals use mucin-derived sugars in situ as well as their potential to impede pathogen colonization. Here, we identify mouse gut commensals that utilize mucus-derived monosaccharides within complex communities using single-cell stable isotope probing, Raman-activated cell sorting and mini-metagenomics. Sequencing of cell-sorted fractions reveals members of the underexplored family Muribaculaceae as major mucin monosaccharide foragers, followed by members of Lachnospiraceae, Rikenellaceae, and Bacteroidaceae families. Using this information, we assembled a five-member consortium of sialic acid and N-acetylglucosamine utilizers that impedes C. difficile’s access to these mucosal sugars and impairs pathogen colonization in antibiotic-treated mice. Our findings underscore the value of targeted approaches to identify organisms utilizing key nutrients and to rationally design effective probiotic mixtures. Here, the authors employ Raman-Activated Cell Sorting (RACS) and metagenomics to identify organisms that can forage on O-glycan monosaccharides in the mouse gut, which they use to construct a bacterial consortium able to reduce Clostridioides difficile colonization based on competition for mucosal sugars.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen",Community (taxonomy) profiling,"(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
490,2020,Deciphering Microbial Community Dynamics and Biochemical Changes During Nyons Black Olive Natural Fermentations,"French PDO Nyons black table olives are produced according to a traditional slow spontaneous fermentation in brine. The manufacture and unique sensorial properties of these olives thus only rely on the autochthonous complex microbiota. This study aimed at unraveling the microbial communities and dynamics of Nyons olives during a 1.5-year-long spontaneous fermentation to determine the main microbial drivers and link microbial species to key metabolites. Fermentations were monitored at a local producer plant at regular time intervals for two harvests and two olive types (organically and conventionally grown) using culture-dependent and metabarcoding (ITS2 for fungi, V3-V4 region for bacteria) approaches. Olives and brines were also sampled for volatiles, organic acids and phenolic compounds. No major differences in microbiota composition were observed according to olive type or harvest period. Throughout the fermentation, yeasts were clearly the most dominant. ITS2 sequencing data revealed complex fungal diversity dominated by Citeromyces nyonsensis, Wickerhamomyces anomalus, Zygotorulaspora mrakii, Candida boidinii and Pichia membranifaciens species. Bacterial communities were dominated by the Celerinatantimonas genus, while lactic acid bacteria remained scarce. Clear shifts in microbial communities and biochemical profiles were observed during fermentation and, by correlating metabolites and microbiota changes, four different phases were distinguished. During the first 7 days, phase I, a fast decrease of filamentous fungal and bacterial populations was observed. Between days 21 and 120, phase II, W. anomalus and C. nyonsensis for fungi and Celerinatantimonas diazotrophica for bacteria dominated the fermentation and were linked to the pH decrease and citric acid production. Phase III, between 120 and 183 days, was characterized by an increase in acids and esters and correlated to increased abundances of Z. mrakii, P. membranifaciens and C. boidinii. During the last months of fermentation, phase IV, microbial communities were dominated by P. membranifaciens and C. boidinii. Both species were strongly correlated to an increase in fruity esters and alcohol abundances. Overall, this study provides an in-depth understanding about microbial species succession and how the microbiota shapes the final distinct olive characteristics. It also constitutes a first step to identify key drivers of this fermentation.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,"Metabarcoding, Metabolomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
491,2020,Predicting antimicrobial susceptibility from the bacterial genome: A new paradigm for one health resistance monitoring.,"The laboratory identification of antibacterial resistance is a cornerstone of infectious disease medicine. In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing has long been based on the growth response of organisms in pure culture to a defined concentration of antimicrobial agents. By comparing individual isolates to wild-type susceptibility patterns, strains with acquired resistance can be identified. Acquired resistance can also be detected genetically. After many decades of research, the inventory of genes underlying antimicrobial resistance is well known for several pathogenic genera including zoonotic enteric organisms such as Salmonella and Campylobacter and continues to grow substantially for others. With the decline in costs for large scale DNA sequencing, it is now practicable to characterize bacteria using whole genome sequencing, including the carriage of resistance genes in individual microorganisms and those present in complex biological samples. With genomics, we can generate comprehensive, detailed information on the bacterium, the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, clues to its source, and the nature of mobile DNA elements by which resistance spreads. These developments point to a new paradigm for antimicrobial resistance detection and tracking for both clinical and public health purposes.","Bacteria, Pathogen","Isolate, AMR",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease
492,2020,Novel mechanisms of type IV pilus regulation in Acinetobacter baylyi,"Bacteria employ extracellular appendages called type IV pili (T4P) to interact with their environment. T4P are essential for diverse microbial behaviors including DNA uptake, surface sensing, virulence, protein secretion, and twitching motility1. While T4P have been studied extensively, our understanding of these nanomachines largely comes from work on a few model species. Here, we develop Acinetobacter baylyi as a new model organism to study T4P and uncover several unreported mechanisms of T4P regulation. First, using recently-developed T4P-labeling methods2,3, we demonstrate that A. baylyi T4P are synthesized on one side of the cell body along the long axis of the cell, and we uncover that this pattern is dependent on components of a conserved chemosensory pathway. Second, we overturn the current dogma that T4P extension occurs through the action of a single, highly conserved ATP-hydrolyzing motor (ATPase) called PilB by showing that T4P synthesis in A. baylyi is dependent on two partially redundant and phylogenetically distinct motors, PilB and PilB2. Third, we uncover a small protein inhibitor of T4P synthesis that specifically inhibits PilB but not PilB2 activity. Together, these results demonstrate novel mechanisms of T4P regulation, which have broad implications for the unexplored diversity of T4P biology in microbial species.",Bacteria,Community (taxonomy) profiling,,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
493,2020,"Associations Among Plant-Based Diet Quality, Uremic Toxins, and Gut Microbiota Profile in Adults Undergoing Hemodialysis Therapy.","OBJECTIVE
The objective of the study was to evaluate associations among diet quality, serum uremic toxin concentrations, and the gut microbiota profile in adults undergoing hemodialysis therapy.


DESIGN AND METHODS
This is a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a clinical trial involving adults receiving hemodialysis therapy. Usual dietary intake was determined using a diet history method administered by Accredited Practising Dietitians. Two approaches were used for diet quality assessment: (1) using three a priori defined plant-based diet indices-an overall plant-based diet index (PDI), a healthy PDI, and an unhealthy PDI and (2) classification of food group intake. Serum uremic toxins (p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate (IS); free and total) were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Gut microbiota composition was established through sequencing the 16S rRNA gene in stool samples.


RESULTS
Twenty-two adults (median age 70.5 [interquartile range: 59-76], 64% male) were included in the final analysis. Higher adherence to the PDI was associated with lower total IS levels (P = .028), independent of dialysis adequacy, urinary output, and blood albumin levels. In contrast, higher adherence to the unhealthy PDI was associated with increases in both free and total IS. Several other direct and inverse associations between diet quality with uremic toxins, microbial relative abundances, and diversity metrics were also highlighted. Diet-associated taxa showed significantly different trends of association with serum uremic toxin concentrations (P < .05). Higher adherence to the PDI was negatively associated with relative abundances of Haemophilus and Haemophilus parainfluenzae that were related to elevated total IS levels. In contrast, increased intake of food items considered unhealthy, such as animal fats, sweets and desserts, were associated with bacteria linked to higher IS and p-cresyl sulfate (total and free) concentrations.


CONCLUSIONS
The quality of diet and food selections may influence uremic toxin production by the gut microbiota in adults receiving hemodialysis. Well-designed dietary intervention trials that adopt multi-omic technologies appropriate for the functional annotation of the gut microbiome are needed to validate our findings and establish causality.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Annotation",Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
494,2020,Chlorella vulgaris and Its Phycosphere in Wastewater: Microalgae-Bacteria Interactions During Nutrient Removal,"Microalgae-based bioenergy production is a promising field with regard to the wide variety of algal species and metabolic potential. The use of liquid wastes as nutrient clearly improves the sustainability of microalgal biofuel production. Microalgae and bacteria have an ecological inter-kingdom relationship. This microenvironment called phycosphere has a major role in the ecosystem productivity and can be utilized both in bioremediation and biomass production. However, knowledge on the effects of indigenous bacteria on microalgal growth and the characteristics of bacterial communities associated with microalgae are limited. In this study municipal, industrial and agricultural liquid waste derivatives were used as cultivation media. Chlorella vulgaris green microalgae and its bacterial partners efficiently metabolized the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous content available in these wastes. The read-based metagenomics approach revealed a diverse microbial composition at the start point of cultivations in the different types of liquid wastes. The relative abundance of the observed taxa significantly changed over the cultivation period. The genome-centric reconstruction of phycospheric bacteria further explained the observed correlations between the taxonomic composition and biomass yield of the various waste-based biodegradation systems. Functional profile investigation of the reconstructed microbes revealed a variety of relevant biological processes like organic acid oxidation and vitamin B synthesis. Thus, liquid wastes were shown to serve as valuable resources of nutrients as well as of growth promoting bacteria enabling increased microalgal biomass production.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
495,2020,"Characterization of Salmonella Resistome and Plasmidome in Pork Production System in Jiangsu, China","The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic Salmonella is a significant ongoing concern over the world. Several reports have investigated the prevalence of Salmonella infections in the farm animals in China; however, there is only limited knowledge about the Salmonella cross-contamination in the slaughterhouses. Moreover, the application of genomic approaches for understanding the cross-contamination in the food-animal slaughterhouses is still in its infancy in China. In the present study, we have isolated 105 Salmonella strains from pig carcasses and environment samples collected from four independent slaughterhouses in Jiangsu, China. All the Salmonella isolates were subjected to whole genome sequencing, bioinformatics analysis for serovar predictions, multi-locus sequence types, antimicrobial resistance genes, and plasmid types by using the in-house Galaxy platform. The antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella isolates was determined using a minimal inhibitory concentration assay with 14 antimicrobials. We found that the predominant serovar and serogroup was S.

All the isolates were multidrug-resistant and the highest resistance was observed against antimicrobials tetracycline (95.4%) and trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (90.9%). Additionally, the colistin-resistant determinant mcr-1 gene was detected in five (4.8%) strains.

497,2020,Development of an NGS-Based Workflow for Improved Monitoring of Circulating Plasmids in Support of Risk Assessment of Antimicrobial Resistance Gene Dissemination,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most prominent public health threats. AMR genes localized on plasmids can be easily transferred between bacterial isolates by horizontal gene transfer, thereby contributing to the spread of AMR. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are ideal for the detection of AMR genes; however, reliable reconstruction of plasmids is still a challenge due to large repetitive regions. This study proposes a workflow to reconstruct plasmids with NGS data in view of AMR gene localization, i.e., chromosomal or on a plasmid. Whole-genome and plasmid DNA extraction methods were compared, as were assemblies consisting of short reads (Illumina MiSeq), long reads (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and a combination of both (hybrid). Furthermore, the added value of conjugation of a plasmid to a known host was evaluated. As a case study, an isolate harboring a large, low-copy mcr-1-carrying plasmid (>200 kb) was used. Hybrid assemblies of NGS data obtained from whole-genome DNA extractions of the original isolates resulted in the most complete reconstruction of plasmids. The optimal workflow was successfully applied to multidrug-resistant Salmonella Kentucky isolates, where the transfer of an ESBL-gene-containing fragment from a plasmid to the chromosome was detected. This study highlights a strategy including wet and dry lab parameters that allows accurate plasmid reconstruction, which will contribute to an improved monitoring of circulating plasmids and the assessment of their risk of transfer.",Bacteria,"Isolate, AMR",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease
498,2020,Association of Gut Microbiota during Early Pregnancy with Risk of Incident Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.,"AIMS
We aimed to assess the association between gut bacterial biomarkers during early pregnancy and subsequent risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in Chinese pregnant women.


METHODS
Within the Tongji-Shuangliu Birth Cohort study, we conducted a nested case-control study among 201 incident GDM cases and 201 matched controls. Fecal samples were collected during early pregnancy (at 6-15 weeks), and GDM was diagnosed at 24-28 weeks of pregnancy. Community DNA isolated from fecal samples and V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries were sequenced.


RESULTS
In GDM cases versus controls, Rothia, Actinomyces, Bifidobacterium, Adlercreutzia, and Coriobacteriaceae, and Lachnospiraceae spp. were significantly reduced, while Enterobacteriaceae, Ruminococcaceae spp. and Veillonellaceae were over-represented. In addition, the abundance of Staphylococcus relative to Clostridium, Roseburia and Coriobacteriaceae as reference microorganisms were positively correlated with fasting blood glucose, 1-h and 2-h postprandial glucose levels. Adding microbial taxa to the base GDM prediction model with conventional risk factors increased the C-statistic significantly (P<0.001) from 0.69 to 0.75.


CONCLUSIONS
Gut microbiota during early pregnancy was associated with subsequent risk of GDM. Several beneficial and commensal gut microorganisms showed inverse relations with incident GDM, while opportunistic pathogenic members were related to higher risk of incident GDM and positively correlated with glucose levels on OGTT.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, Gene identification / Biomarker",Metabarcoding,Health & Disease
499,2020,Precision long-read metagenomics sequencing for food safety by detection and assembly of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli in irrigation water,"Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) contamination of agricultural water might be an important factor to recent foodborne illness and outbreaks involving leafy greens. Whole genome sequencing generation of closed bacterial genomes plays an important role in source tracking. We aimed to determine the limits of detection and classification of STECs by qPCR and nanopore sequencing using enriched irrigation water artificially contaminated with E. coli O157:H7 (EDL933). We determined the limit of STEC detection by qPCR to be 30 CFU/reaction, which is equivalent to 105 CFU/ml in the enrichment. By using Oxford Nanopore’s EPI2ME WIMP workflow and de novo assembly with Flye followed by taxon classification with a k-mer analysis software (Kraken), E. coli O157:H7 could be detected at 103 CFU/ml (68 reads) and a complete fragmented E. coli O157:H7 metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) was obtained at 105-108 CFU/ml. Using a custom script to extract the E. coli reads, a completely closed MAG was obtained at 107-108 CFU/ml and a complete, fragmented MAG was obtained at 105-106 CFU/ml. In silico virulence detection for E. coli MAGs for 105-108 CFU/ml showed that the virulotype was indistinguishable from the spiked E. coli O157:H7 strain. We further identified the bacterial species in the un-spiked enrichment, including antimicrobial resistance genes, which could have important implications to food safety. We propose this workflow could be used for detection and complete genomic characterization of STEC from a complex microbial sample and could be applied to determine the limit of detection and assembly of other foodborne bacterial pathogens. IMPORTANCE Foodborne illness caused by Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) ranges in severity from diarrhea to hemolytic uremic syndrome and produce-related incidence is increasing. The pervasive nature of E. coli requires not only detection, but also a complete genome to determine potential pathogenicity based on stx and eae genes, serotype, and other virulence factors. We have developed a pipeline to determine the limits of nanopore sequencing for STECs in a metagenomic sample. By utilizing the current qPCR in the FDA Bacteriological Analytical Manual (BAM) Chapter 4A, we can quantify the amount of STEC in the enrichment and then sequence and classify the STEC in less than half the time as current protocols that require a single isolate. These methods have wide implications for food safety, including decreased time to STEC identification during outbreaks, characterization of the microbial community, and the potential to use these methods to determine the limits for other foodborne pathogens.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR, MAGs","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
500,2020,"Assessment of bacterial diversity of Rhipicephalus microplus ticks from two livestock agroecosystems in Antioquia, Colombia","Rhipicephalus microplus is recognized as a tick species highly prevalent in cattle, with a wide pantropical distribution that seems to continue spreading geographically. However, its role as a biological vector has been scarcely studied in the livestock context. In this study, a 16S rRNA next-generation sequencing analysis was used to determine bacterial diversity in salivary glands and gut of R. microplus from two contrasting livestock agroecosystems in Antioquia, Colombia. Both the culture-independent approach (CI) and the culture-dependent (CD) approach were complementarily adopted in this study. A total of 341 unique OTUs were assigned, the richness showed to be higher in the Northern than in the Middle Magdalena region, and a high diversity was found at the phylum and genus levels in the samples obtained. With the CI approach, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria were the most common phylum of bacteria regardless of the organ, or geographic origin of the specimens analyzed. While the relative abundance of bacteria at a phylum level with the CD approach varied between analyzed samples, the data obtained suggest that a high diversity of species of bacteria occurs in R. microplus from both livestock agroecosystems. Bacterial genera such as Anaplasma, Coxiella, and Ehrlichia, recognized for their implications in tick-borne diseases, were also detected, together with endosymbionts such as Lysinibacillus, previously reported as a potential tool for biological control. This information is useful to deepen the knowledge about microbial diversity regarding the relations between endosymbionts and pathogens and could facilitate the future development of epidemiological surveillance in livestock systems.","Bacteria, Pathogen",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
501,2020,Identification of new insect Host Defense Peptides (HDP) from Dung Beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) transcriptomes,"Introduction The Coleoptera Scarabaeidae family is one of the most diverse groups of insects on the planet, living in complex microbiological environments. Their immune systems have evolved with the generation of host defense peptides but only a small number of these peptides have been characterized. Methods In this work two sources of information were retrieved: 1) De novo transcriptomic data from two species of neotropical Scarabidae (Dichotomius satanas and Ontophagus curvicornis); 2) Sequence data deposited in available databases. A BLAST-based search against the transcriptomes with a subset of sequences representative of the Host Defense Peptides (HDP). The HDP were described with the cecropin, defensin, attacin, and coleoptericin families; their physical/chemical and structural properties were described. Results This work reports 155 novel sequences of HDP identified in 9 transcriptomes from seven species from the Coleoptera order: D. satanas (n= 76; 49.03%), O. curvicornis (n= 23; 14.83%), T. dichotomus (n= 18; 11.61%), O. nigriventris (n= 10; 6.45%), Heterochelus sp (n= 6; 3.87%), O. conspicillatum (n= 18; 11.61%) and P. japonica (n= 4; 2.58%). These sequences were identified based on similarity to known HDP insect families. New members of defensins (n= 58; 37.42%), cecropins (n= 18; 11.61%), attancins (n= 41; 26.45%) and coleoptericins (n= 38; 24.52%), with their physicochemical, structural characteristics, and sequence relationship to other insect HDP were analyzed. Conclusions 155 new HDP could be identified, based on similarity to known HDP insect families on nine transcriptome sequences of seven beetle species.

502,2020,Impact of Short-Term Isoflavone Intervention in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Patients on Microbiota Composition and Metagenomics,"Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 5–20% of women of reproductive age worldwide and is associated with disorders of glucose metabolism. Hormone and metabolic signaling may be influenced by phytoestrogens, such as isoflavones. Their endocrine effects may modify symptom penetrance in PCOS. Equol is one of the most active isoflavone metabolites, produced by intestinal bacteria, and acts as a selective estrogen receptor modulator. Method: In this interventional study of clinical and biochemical characterization, urine isoflavone levels were measured in PCOS and control women before and three days after a defined isoflavone intervention via soy milk. In this interventional study, bacterial equol production was evaluated using the log(equol: daidzein ratio) and microbiome, metabolic, and predicted metagenome analyses were performed. Results: After isoflavone intervention, predicted stool metagenomic pathways, microbial alpha diversity, and glucose homeostasis in PCOS improved resembling the profile of the control group at baseline. In the whole cohort, larger equol production was associated with lower androgen as well as fertility markers. Conclusion: The dynamics in our metabolic, microbiome, and predicted metagenomic profiles underline the importance of external phytohormones on PCOS characteristics and a potential therapeutic approach or prebiotic in the future.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,"(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics, Metabolomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
503,2020,Identification of an unauthorized genetically modified bacteria in food enzyme through whole-genome sequencing,"Recently, the unexpected presence of a viable unauthorized genetically modified bacterium in a commercialized food enzyme (protease) product originating from a microbial fermentation process has been notified at the European level (RASFF 2019.3332). This finding was made possible thanks to the use of the next-generation sequencing technology, as reported in this study. Whole-genome sequencing was used to characterize the genetic modification comprising a sequence from the pUB110 shuttle vector (GenBank: M19465.1), harbouring antimicrobial resistance genes conferring a resistance to kanamycine, neomycin and bleomycin, flanked on each side by a sequence coding for a protease (GenBank: WP_032874795.1). In addition, based on these data, two real-time PCR methods, that can be used by enforcement laboratories, specific to this unauthorized genetically modified bacterium were developed and validated. The present study emphasizes the key role that whole-genome sequencing can take for detection of unknown and unauthorized genetically modified microorganisms in commercialized microbial fermentation products intended for the food and feed chain. Moreover, current issues encountered by the Competent Authorities and enforcement laboratories with such unexpected contaminations and the importance of performing official controls were highlighted.",Bacteria,AMR,(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
504,2020,Precursor Intensity-Based Label-Free Quantification Software Tools for Proteomic and Multi-Omic Analysis within the Galaxy Platform,"For mass spectrometry-based peptide and protein quantification, label-free quantification (LFQ) based on precursor mass peak (MS1) intensities is considered reliable due to its dynamic range, reproducibility, and accuracy. In LFQ workflows, protein abundance changes are inferred from peptide-level information, including microbial peptides (for metaproteomics) and peptides carrying post-translational modifications (for proteomics) and/or variant sequences (for proteogenomics). Multi-omics studies (such as proteogenomics and metaproteomics) rely on peptide detection and quantification to identify and quantify peptides that map to unique proteoforms and metaproteins. The Galaxy for proteomics (Galaxy-P) platform has proven useful for the development of accessible workflows to identify proteins in these complex multi-omic studies. However, proteomics workflows within the Galaxy platform have lacked well-tested label-free quantification tools. In this study, our main goals were to evaluate two recently published open-source LFQ tools and to implement them within the Galaxy platform, enabling their easy integration with established workflows. These two tools, moFF and FlashLFQ, were selected based on their described peptide quantification capabilities and amenability to Galaxy implementation. Through rigorous testing and communication with the tools’ developers, we gained insights into the software features necessary for maximizing the performance of each tool. Software features evaluated included: a) match-between-runs (MBR); b) using both Thermo .raw and HUPO standards .mzML file formats as input for improved quantification; c) use of containers and/or conda packages; d) parameters needed for analyzing large input datasets; and e) optimization and validation of software performance. This work 1) establishes a process for software implementation, optimization and validation within Galaxy; and 2) makes powerful new tools for LFQ available which should prove highly useful for a variety of proteomics and multi-omics applications employing the Galaxy platform.",,Variant,"(Meta)genomics, (Meta)proteomics, Metaproteomics",
505,2020,Identification of Gastrointestinal Microbiota in Hawaiian Green Turtles (Chelonia mydas),"Green turtles (Chelonia mydas) have a hindgut fermentation digestive tract, which uses cellulolytic microbes to break down plant matter in the cecum and proximal colon. Previous studies on bacterial communities of green turtles have not identified in situ hindgut microbiota, and never before in Hawaiian green turtles, which comprise an isolated metapopulation. Fresh samples using sterile swabs were taken from five locations along the gastrointestinal tracts of eight green turtles that had required euthanization. Bacteria were cultured, aerobically and anaerobically, on nutrient agar and four differential and selective media. Samples at three sections along the gastrointestinal tracts of two green turtles were analyzed using 16S metagenomics on an Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine. More than half of the 4 532 104 sequences belonged to the phylum Firmicutes, followed by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, which are characteristic of herbivore gut microbiota. Some microbiota variation existed between turtles and among gastrointestinal sections. The 16S sequence analysis provided a better representation of the total gastrointestinal bacterial community, much of which cannot be cultured using traditional microbial techniques. These metagenomic analyses serve as a foundation for a better understanding of the microbiome of green turtles in the Hawaiian Islands and elsewhere.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
506,2020,A mass spectrometry‐based high‐throughput screening method for engineering fatty acid synthases with improved production of medium‐chain fatty acids,"Microbial cell factories have been extensively engineered to produce free fatty acids (FFAs) as key components of crucial nutrients, soaps, industrial chemicals, and fuels. However, our ability to control the composition of microbially synthesized FFAs is still limited, particularly, for producing medium‐chain fatty acids (MCFAs). This is mainly due to the lack of high‐throughput approaches for FFA analysis to engineer enzymes with desirable product specificity. Here we report a mass spectrometry (MS)‐based method for rapid profiling of MCFAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by using membrane lipids as a proxy. In particular, matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionization time‐of‐flight (MALDI‐ToF) MS was used to detect shorter acyl chain phosphatidylcholines from membrane lipids and a higher m/z peak ratio at 730 and 758 was used as an indication for improved MCFA production. This colony‐based method can be performed at a rate of ~2 s per sample, representing a substantial improvement over gas chromatography‐MS (typically >30 min per sample) as the gold standard method for FFA detection. To demonstrate the power of this method, we performed site‐saturation mutagenesis of the yeast fatty acid synthase and identified nine missense mutations that resulted in improved MCFA production relative to the wild‐type strain. Colony‐based MALDI‐ToF MS screening provides an effective approach for engineering microbial fatty acid compositions in a high‐throughput manner.",,,(Meta)proteomics,
507,2020,Design of Bacterial Strain-Specific qPCR Assays Using NGS Data and Publicly Available Resources and Its Application to Track Biocontrol Strains,"Biological control is emerging as a feasible alternative to chemical pesticides in agriculture. Measuring the microbial biocontrol agent (mBCA) populations in the environment is essential for an accurate environmental and health risk assessment and for optimizing the usage of an mBCA-based plant protection product. We hereby show a workflow to obtain a large number of qPCR markers suitable for robust strain-specific quantification. The workflow starts from whole genome sequencing data and consists of four stages: (i) identifying the strain-specific sequences, (ii) designing specific primer/probe sets for qPCR, and (iii) empirically verifying the performance of the assays. The first two stages involve exclusively computer work, but they are intended for researchers with little or no bioinformatic background: Only a knowledge of the BLAST suite tools and work with spreadsheets are required; a familiarity with the Galaxy environment and next-generation sequencing concepts are strongly advised. All bioinformatic work can be implemented using publicly available resources and a regular desktop computer (no matter the operating system) connected to the Internet. The workflow was tested with five bacterial strains from four different genera under development as mBCAs and yielded thousands of candidate markers and a triplex qPCR assay for each candidate mBCA. The qPCR assays were successfully tested in soils of different natures, water from different sources, and with samples from different plant tissues. The mBCA detection limits and population dynamics in the different matrices are similar to those in qPCR assays designed by other means. In summary, a new accessible, cost-effective, and robust workflow to obtain a large number of strain-specific qPCR markers is presented.",Bacteria,,(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
508,2020,Bacteriophage-Insensitive Mutants of Antimicrobial-Resistant Salmonella Enterica are Altered in their Tetracycline Resistance and Virulence in Caco-2 Intestinal Cells,"Bacteriophages have shown promise as therapeutic alternatives to antibiotics for the control of infectious bacteria, including the human pathogen Salmonella. However, the development of effective phage-based applications requires the elucidation of key interactions between phages and target hosts, particularly since host resistance to phage is inevitable. Little is known about the alteration of host phenotypes following the development of resistance to phage. The aim of this study is to evaluate the antibiotic susceptibility and virulence of a Salmonella isolate following the development of resistance to bacteriophage SI1. We observed enhanced susceptibility to tetracycline and decreased invasion capacity in a differentiated Caco-2 intestinal cell line. Whole genome sequence analysis revealed an array of mutations, most notably, truncations in vgrG1_2, a core gene involved in Type VI secretion and mutations in the lipopolysaccharide, thereby indicating the plausible attachment site of phage SI1. These findings shed light on understanding the underlying mechanism for phage immunity within the host. Importantly, we reveal an associated genetic cost to the bacterial host with developing resistance to phages. Taken together, these results will aid in advancing strategies to delay or eliminate the development of host resistance when designing informed phage-based antimicrobials.","Bacteria, Virus, Pathogen","Isolate, Interactome, AMR",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease
509,2020,Whole Genome Sequencing Differentiates Presumptive Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase Producing Escherichia coli along Segments of the One Health Continuum,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has important implications for the continued use of antibiotics to control infectious diseases in both beef cattle and humans. AMR along the One Health continuum of the beef production system is largely unknown. Here, whole genomes of presumptive extended-spectrum β-lactamase E. coli (ESBL-EC) from cattle feces (n = 40), feedlot catch basins (n = 42), surrounding streams (n = 21), a beef processing plant (n = 4), municipal sewage (n = 30), and clinical patients (n = 25) are described. ESBL-EC were isolated from ceftriaxone selective plates and subcultured on ampicillin selective plates. Agreement of genotype-phenotype prediction of AMR ranged from 93.2% for ampicillin to 100% for neomycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and enrofloxacin resistance. Overall, β-lactam (100%; blaEC, blaTEM-1, blaSHV, blaOXA, blaCTX-M-), tetracycline (90.1%; tet(A), tet(B)) and folate synthesis (sul2) antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) were most prevalent. The ARGs tet(C), tet(M), tet(32), blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-14, blaOXA-1, dfrA18, dfrA19, catB3, and catB4 were exclusive to human sources, while blaTEM-150, blaSHV-11–12, dfrA12, cmlA1, and cmlA5 were exclusive to beef cattle sources. Frequently encountered virulence factors across all sources included adhesion and type II and III secretion systems, while IncFIB(AP001918) and IncFII plasmids were also common. Specificity and prevalence of ARGs between cattle-sourced and human-sourced presumptive ESBL-EC likely reflect differences in antimicrobial use in cattle and humans. Comparative genomics revealed phylogenetically distinct clusters for isolates from human vs. cattle sources, implying that human infections caused by ESBL-EC in this region might not originate from beef production sources.",,"Isolate, AMR, Comparative analysis",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
510,2020,Optimization of Preservation Methods Allows Deeper Insights into Changes of Raw Milk Microbiota,"The temporal instability of raw milk microbiota drastically affects the reliability of microbiome studies. However, little is known about the microbial integrity in preserved samples. Raw cow milk samples were preserved with azidiol or bronopol and stored at 4 °C, or with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or a mixture of azidiol and DMSO and stored at −20 °C for up to 30 days. Aliquots of 5-, 10-, and 30-day post-storage were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA), then analyzed by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 and V6-V8 regions. The V6-V8 gave a higher richness and lower diversity than the V3-V4 region. After 5-day storage at 4 °C, the microbiota of unpreserved samples was characterized by a drastic decrease in diversity, and a significant shift in community structure. The treatment with azidiol and DMSO conferred the best community stabilization in preserved raw milk. Interestingly, the azidiol treatment performed as well for up to 10 days, thus appearing as a suitable alternative. However, neither azidiol nor bronopol could minimize fungal proliferation as revealed by PMA-qPCR assays. This study demonstrates the preservative ability of a mixture of azidiol and DMSO and provides deeper insights into the microbial changes occurring during the cold storage of preserved raw milk.",Microbiome,Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

512,2020,Boreal Forest Multifunctionality Is Promoted by Low Soil Organic Matter Content and High Regional Bacterial Biodiversity in Northeastern Canada,"Boreal forests provide important ecosystem services, most notably being the mitigation of increasing atmospheric CO2 emissions. Microbial biodiversity, particularly the local diversity of fungi, has been shown to promote multiple functions of the boreal forests of Northeastern China. However, this microbial biodiversity-multifunctionality relationship has yet to be explored in Northeastern Canada, where historical environment have shaped a different regional pool of microbial diversity. This study focuses on the relationship between the soil microbiome and ecosystem multifunctionality, as well as the influence of pH and redox potential (Eh) on the regulation of such relationship. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to explore the different causal relationships existing in the studied ecosystems. In a managed part of the Canadian boreal forest, 156 forest polygons were sampled to (1) estimate the α- and β-diversity of fungal and bacterial communities and (2) measure 12 ecosystem functions mainly related to soil nutrient storage and cycling. Both bacteria and fungi influenced ecosystem multifunctionality, but on their own respective functions. Bacterial β-diversity was the most important factor increasing primary productivity and soil microbial biomass, while reducing soil emitted atmospheric CO2. Environmental characteristics, particularly low levels of organic matter in soil, were shown to have the strongest positive impact on boreal ecosystem multifunctionality. Overall, our results were consistent with those obtained in Northeastern China; however, some differences need to be further explored especially considering the history of forest management in Northeastern Canada.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis",,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
513,2020,Horizontal gene transfer in the human and skin commensal Malassezia: a bacterially-derived flavohemoglobin is required for NO resistance and host interaction,"The skin of humans and animals is colonized by commensal and pathogenic fungi and bacteria that share this ecological niche and have established microbial interactions. Malassezia are the most abundant fungal skin inhabitant of all warm-blooded animals, and have been implicated in skin diseases and systemic disorders, including Crohn’s disease and pancreatic cancer. Flavohemoglobin is a key enzyme involved in microbial nitrosative stress resistance and nitric oxide degradation. Comparative genomics and phylogenetic analyses within the Malassezia genus revealed that extant flavohemoglobin-encoding genes are present as single copy in different species, but were acquired through independent horizontal gene transfer events from different donor bacteria that are part of the mammalian microbiome. Through targeted gene deletion and functional complementation in M. sympodialis, we demonstrated that both bacterially-derived flavohemoglobins are cytoplasmic proteins required for nitric oxide detoxification and nitrosative stress resistance under aerobic conditions. RNAseq analysis revealed that endogenous accumulation of nitric oxide resulted in upregulation of genes involved in stress responses, and downregulation of the MalaS7 allergen-encoding gene. Solution of the high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of Malassezia flavohemoglobin revealed features conserved with both bacterial and fungal flavohemoglobins. In vivo pathogenesis is independent of Malassezia flavohemoglobin. Lastly, we identified additional 30 genus- and species-specific horizontal gene transfer candidates that might have contributed to the evolution of this genus as the most common inhabitants of animal skin.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Functional analysis, Interactome, AMR, Comparative analysis",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
514,2020,MicroRNA and mRNA interactions coordinate the immune response in non-lethal heat stressed Litopenaeus vannamei against AHPND-causing Vibrio parahaemolyticus,"While Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VPAHPND) has been identified as the cause of early mortality syndrome (EMS) or acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) in shrimp, mechanisms of host response remain unknown. Understanding these processes is important to improve farming practices because this understanding will help to develop methods to enhance shrimp immunity. Pre-treatment of shrimp with 5-minute chronic non-lethal heat stress (NLHS) for 7 days was found to significantly increase Litopenaeus vannamei survival against VPAHPND infection. To elucidate the mechanism involved, mRNA and miRNA expression profiles from the hemocyte of L. vannamei challenged with VPAHPND after NLHS with corresponding control conditions were determined by RNA-Seq. A total of 2,664 mRNAs and 41 miRNAs were differentially expressed after the NLHS treatment and VPAHPND challenge. A miRNA-mRNA regulatory network of differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was subsequently constructed and the interactions of DEMs in regulating the NLHS-induced immune-related pathways were identified. Transcriptomic data revealed that miRNA and mRNA interactions contribute to the modulation of NLHS-induced immune responses, such as the prophenoloxidase-activating system, hemocyte homeostasis, and antimicrobial peptide production, and these responses enhance VPAHPND resistance in L. vannamei.",,"Interactome, AMR",(Meta)transcriptomics,Health & Disease
515,2020,Expanded Phylogenetic Diversity and Metabolic Flexibility of Microbial Mercury Methylation,"Methylmercury is a potent, bioaccumulating neurotoxin that is produced by specific microorganisms by methylation of inorganic mercury released from anthropogenic sources. The hgcAB genes were recently discovered to be required for microbial methylmercury production in diverse anaerobic bacteria and archaea. However, the full phylogenetic and metabolic diversity of mercury methylating microorganisms has not been fully explored due to the limited number of cultured, experimentally verified methylators and the limitations of primer-based molecular methods. Here, we describe the phylogenetic diversity and metabolic flexibility of putative mercury methylating microorganisms identified by hgcA sequence identity from publicly available isolate genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), as well as novel freshwater MAGs. We demonstrate that putative mercury methylators are much more phylogenetically diverse than previously known, and the distribution of hgcA is most likely due to several independent horizontal gene transfer events. Identified methylating microorganisms possess diverse metabolic capabilities spanning carbon fixation, sulfate reduction, nitrogen fixation, and metal resistance pathways. Using a metatranscriptomic survey of a thawing permafrost gradient from which we identified 111 putative mercury methylators, we demonstrate that specific methylating populations may contribute to hgcA expression at different depths. Overall, we provide a framework for illuminating the microbial basis of mercury methylation using genome-resolved metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to identify methylators based upon hgcA presence and describe their putative functions in the environment. IMPORTANCE Specific anaerobic microorganisms among the Deltaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Euryarchaeota have been shown to produce the bioaccumulating neurotoxin methylmercury. Accurately assessing the sources of microbial methylmercury production in the context of phylogenetic identification, metabolic guilds, and activity in the environment is crucial for understanding the constraints and effects of mercury impacted sites. Advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have enabled large-scale, cultivation-independent surveys of diverse and poorly characterized microorganisms of numerous ecosystems. We used genome-resolved metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to highlight the vast phylogenetic and metabolic diversity of putative mercury methylators, and their depth-discrete activities in the environment. This work underscores the importance of using genome-resolved metagenomics to survey specific putative methylating populations of a given mercury-impacted ecosystem.","Bacteria, Archaea","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, AMR, MAGs","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics, (Meta)transcriptomics, Metatranscriptomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
516,2020,Ultradeep Microbial Communities at 4.4 km within Crystalline Bedrock: Implications for Habitability in a Planetary Context,"The deep bedrock surroundings are an analog for extraterrestrial habitats for life. In this study, we investigated microbial life within anoxic ultradeep boreholes in Precambrian bedrock, including the adaptation to environmental conditions and lifestyle of these organisms. Samples were collected from Pyhäsalmi mine environment in central Finland and from geothermal drilling wells in Otaniemi, Espoo, in southern Finland. Microbial communities inhabiting the up to 4.4 km deep bedrock were characterized with phylogenetic marker gene (16S rRNA genes and fungal ITS region) amplicon and DNA and cDNA metagenomic sequencing. Functional marker genes (dsrB, mcrA, narG) were quantified with qPCR. Results showed that although crystalline bedrock provides very limited substrates for life, the microbial communities are diverse. Gammaproteobacterial phylotypes were most dominant in both studied sites. Alkanindiges -affiliating OTU was dominating in Pyhäsalmi fluids, while different depths of Otaniemi samples were dominated by Pseudomonas. One of the most common OTUs detected from Otaniemi could only be classified to phylum level, highlighting the uncharacterized nature of the deep biosphere in bedrock. Chemoheterotrophy, fermentation and nitrogen cycling are potentially significant metabolisms in these ultradeep environments. To conclude, this study provides information on microbial ecology of low biomass, carbon-depleted and energy-deprived deep subsurface environment. This information is useful in the prospect of finding life in other planetary bodies.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
517,2020,Impacts of Soil Microbiome Variations on Root Colonization by Fungi and Bacteria and on the Metabolome of Populus tremula × alba,"Trees depend on beneficial interactions between roots and soil microbes for their nutrition and protection against stresses. The soil microbiome provides the main reservoir of microbes for root colonization and is subject to natural variations that can affect its composition. It is not clear whether the tree’s root system is able to buffer the natural variations occurring in the soil microbiome to capture a stable and effective microbiome or whether these variations affect its microbiome to impact its physiology. To address this question, we planted cuttings of Gray Poplar (Populus tremula × alba clone 717-1B4) in natural soil taken from a poplar stand under the same tree over two consecutive years and grew them in a greenhouse. We analyzed the soil and root microbiomes by high throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing of fungal rDNA internal transcribed spacer and bacterial 16S rRNA amplicons and we characterized the root metabolome by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Soil and root microbial communities significantly shifted over the 2 years. A modification of the balance between endophytes, saprophytes, and mycorrhizal fungi occurred in the roots as well as a replacement of some dominant operational taxonomic units by others. These modifications were correlated with a significant alteration of the levels of about 10% of primary and secondary metabolites, suggesting that natural fluctuations in soil microbial communities can have a profound impact on tree root metabolism and physiology. Tree roots functioning may thus be indirectly strongly affected by the effects of future extreme climatic variations on the soil microbiome.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome","Metabarcoding, (Meta)proteomics, Metabolomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
518,2019,Attenuated Lactococcus lactis and Surface Bacteria as Tools for Conditioning the Microbiota and Driving the Ripening of Semisoft Caciotta Cheese,"This study provides in-depth knowledge of the effects of attenuated starters and surface bacterial strains on the microbiota and related metabolic activities during cheese ripening. The use of attenuated Lc. lactis strongly impacted the microbiota assembly of caciotta cheese. This led to improved biochemical and sensory features compared to conventional cheese. Among surface bacterial strains, Le. lactis played a key role in the metabolic activities involved in cheese ripening. This resulted in an improvement of the sensory quality of caciotta cheese. The use of attenuated lactic acid bacteria and the surface adjunct Le. lactis could be a useful biotechnology to improve the flavor formation of caciotta cheese. ABSTRACT This study aimed at establishing the effects of attenuated starters and surface bacteria on various features of caciotta cheese. The cheese undergoes a ripening period during which the house microbiota contaminates the surface. Conventional cheese (the control cheese [CC]) is made using only primary starters. Primary starters and attenuated (i.e., unable to grow and synthesize lactic acid) Lactococcus lactis (Lc. lactis) subsp. lactis were used to produce caciotta cheese without (ATT cheese) or with an inoculum of surface bacteria: (i) Leuconostoc lactis (Le. lactis) (LL cheese), (ii) Vibrio casei (VC cheese), (iii) Staphylococcus equorum (SE cheese), (iv) Brochothrix thermosphacta (BX cheese), and (v) a mixture of all four (MIX cheese). Attenuated Lc. lactis increased microbial diversity during cheese ripening. At the core, attenuated starter mainly increased indigenous lactococci and Lactobacillus delbrueckii group bacteria. At the surface, the main effect was on Macrococcus caseolyticus. Autochthonous Le. lactis strains took advantage of the attenuated starter, becoming dominant. Adjunct Le. lactis positively affected Lactobacillus sakei group bacteria on the LL cheese surface. Adjunct V. casei, S. equorum, and B. thermosphacta did not become dominant. Surfaces of VC, SE, and BX cheeses mainly harbored Staphylococcus succinus. Peptidase activities were higher in cheeses made with attenuated starter than in CC, which had the lowest concentration of free amino acids. Based on the enzymatic activities of adjunct Le. lactis, LL and MIX cheeses exhibited the highest glutamate dehydrogenase, cystathionine-γ-lyase, and esterase activities. As shown by multivariate statistical analyses, LL and MIX cheeses showed the highest similarity for microbiological and biochemical features. LL and MIX cheeses received the highest scores for overall sensory acceptability. IMPORTANCE This study provides in-depth knowledge of the effects of attenuated starters and surface bacterial strains on the microbiota and related metabolic activities during cheese ripening. The use of attenuated Lc. lactis strongly impacted the microbiota assembly of caciotta cheese. This led to improved biochemical and sensory features compared to conventional cheese. Among surface bacterial strains, Le. lactis played a key role in the metabolic activities involved in cheese ripening. This resulted in an improvement of the sensory quality of caciotta cheese. The use of attenuated lactic acid bacteria and the surface adjunct Le. lactis could be a useful biotechnology to improve the flavor formation of caciotta cheese.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, MAGs",,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
519,2019,Ear mite infection is associated with altered microbial communities in genetically depauperate Santa Catalina Island foxes (Urocyon littoralis catalinae),"The host‐associated microbiome is increasingly recognized as a critical player in health and immunity. Recent studies have shown that disruption of commensal microbial communities can contribute to disease pathogenesis and severity. Santa Catalina Island foxes (Urocyon littoralis catalinae) present a compelling system in which to examine microbial dynamics in wildlife due to their depauperate genomic structure and extremely high prevalence of ceruminous gland tumors. Although the precise cause is yet unknown, infection with ear mites (Otodectes cynotis) has been linked to chronic inflammation, which is associated with abnormal cell growth and tumor development. Given the paucity of genomic variation in these foxes, other dimensions of molecular diversity, such as commensal microbes, may be critical to host response and disease pathology. We characterized the host‐associated microbiome across six body sites of Santa Catalina Island foxes, and performed differential abundance testing between healthy and mite‐infected ear canals. We found that mite infection was significantly associated with reduced microbial diversity and evenness, with the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus pseudintermedius dominating the ear canal community. These results suggest that secondary bacterial infection may contribute to the sustained inflammation associated with tumor development. As the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains remains a concern of the medical, veterinary, and conservation communities, uncovering high relative abundance of S. pseudintermedius provides critical insight into the pathogenesis of this complex system. Through use of culture‐independent sequencing techniques, this study contributes to the broader effort of applying a more inclusive understanding of molecular diversity to questions within wildlife disease ecology.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
520,2019,Actinomyces Produces Defensin-Like Bacteriocins (Actifensins) with a Highly Degenerate Structure and Broad Antimicrobial Activity,"Bacteriocins (ribosomally produced antimicrobial peptides) are potential alternatives to current antimicrobials given the global challenge of antimicrobial resistance. We identified a novel bacteriocin from Actinomyces ruminicola with no previously characterized antimicrobial activity. Using publicly available genomic data, we found a highly conserved yet divergent family of previously unidentified homologous peptide sequences within the genus Actinomyces with striking similarity to eukaryotic defensins. These actifensins may provide a potent line of antimicrobial defense/offense, and the machinery to produce them could be used for the design of new antimicrobials given the degeneracy that exists naturally in their structure. ABSTRACT We identified a strain of Actinomyces ruminicola which produces a potent bacteriocin with activity against a broad range of Gram-positive bacteria, many of which are pathogenic to animals and humans. The bacteriocin was purified and found to have a mass of 4,091 ± 1 Da with a sequence of GFGCNLITSNPYQCSNHCKSVGYRGGYCKLRTVCTCY containing three disulfide bridges. Surprisingly, near relatives of actifensin were found to be a series of related eukaryotic defensins displaying greater than 50% identity to the bacteriocin. A pangenomic screen further revealed that production of actifensin-related bacteriocins is a common trait within the genus, with 47 being encoded in 161 genomes. Furthermore, these bacteriocins displayed a remarkable level of diversity with a mean amino acid identity of only 52% between strains/species. This level of redundancy suggests that this new class of bacteriocins may provide a very broad structural basis on which to deliver and design new broad-spectrum antimicrobials for treatment of animal and human infections.

521,2019,"MEGARes 2.0: a database for classification of antimicrobial drug, biocide and metal resistance determinants in metagenomic sequence data","Abstract Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a threat to global public health and the identification of genetic determinants of AMR is a critical component to epidemiological investigations. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) provides opportunities for investigation of AMR across all microbial genomes in a sample (i.e. the metagenome). Previously, we presented MEGARes, a hand-curated AMR database and annotation structure developed to facilitate the analysis of AMR within metagenomic samples (i.e. the resistome). Along with MEGARes, we released AmrPlusPlus, a bioinformatics pipeline that interfaces with MEGARes to identify and quantify AMR gene accessions contained within a metagenomic sequence dataset. Here, we present MEGARes 2.0 (https://megares.meglab.org), which incorporates previously published resistance sequences for antimicrobial drugs, while also expanding to include published sequences for metal and biocide resistance determinants. In MEGARes 2.0, the nodes of the acyclic hierarchical ontology include four antimicrobial compound types, 57 classes, 220 mechanisms of resistance, and 1,345 gene groups that classify the 7,868 accessions. In addition, we present an updated version of AmrPlusPlus (AMR ++ version 2.0), which improves accuracy of classifications, as well as expanding scalability and usability.",,"AMR, Annotation","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Health & Disease
522,2019,Characterization of Salmonella enterica Isolates from Selected U.S. Swine Feed Mills by Whole-Genome Sequencing.,"Every year salmonellosis is responsible for $2.3 billion in costs to the U.S. food industry, with nearly 6% of the reported cases associated with pork and/or pork products. Several studies have demonstrated the role of pigs as Salmonella reservoirs. Furthermore, this pathogen has been identified as a potential biological hazard in many livestock feeds. The overall objective of this research was to characterize Salmonella enterica isolates in selected U.S. swine feed mills by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and evaluate isolates in association with the season and feed production stages. Salmonella isolates were collected from 11 facilities during a previous study. Samples were analyzed for Salmonella prevalence following the U.S. Department of Agriculture guidelines and confirmed by PCR. WGS was carried out on either the MiSeq or NextSeq sequencer. De novo genome assemblies were obtained with the Shovill pipeline, version 0.9. ResFinder and SPIFinder were used to identify antibiotic resistance genes and pathogenicity islands. Finally, their phylogenetic relationship and diversity were determined by core genome multilocus sequence typing. Overall, our analysis showed the presence of S. enterica in the feed mill environment. Isolates belonged to 16 different serotypes. Salmonella Agona, Salmonella Mbandaka, Salmonella Senfenberg, and Salmonella Scharzengrund were the most frequently found, and 18 single-nucleotide polymorphism clusters were identified. In silico analysis showed that 40% of the strains carried at least one antimicrobial resistance gene. All isolates in this study could be considered of public health concern and pathogenic potential. Our findings underscore the potential role of the feed mill environment as the pathogen entry route into the human food value chain.",Pathogen,"Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR, SNP, (M)LST",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
523,2019,Shotgun metagenomics reveals both taxonomic and tryptophan pathway differences of gut microbiota in major depressive disorder patients,"Abstract Background The microbiota–gut–brain axis, especially the microbial tryptophan (Trp) biosynthesis and metabolism pathway (MiTBamp), may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, studies on the MiTBamp in MDD are lacking. The aim of the present study was to analyze the gut microbiota composition and the MiTBamp in MDD patients. Methods We performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing of stool samples from 26 MDD patients and 29 healthy controls (HCs). In addition to the microbiota community and the MiTBamp analyses, we also built a classification based on the Random Forests (RF) and Boruta algorithm to identify the gut microbiota as biomarkers for MDD. Results The Bacteroidetes abundance was strongly reduced whereas that of Actinobacteria was significantly increased in the MDD patients compared with the abundance in the HCs. Most noteworthy, the MDD patients had increased levels of Bifidobacterium, which is commonly used as a probiotic. Four Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthologies (KOs) (K01817, K11358, K01626, K01667) abundances in the MiTBamp were significantly lower in the MDD group. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation between the K01626 abundance and the HAMD scores in the MDD group. Finally, RF classification at the genus level can achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.890. Conclusions The present findings enabled a better understanding of the changes in gut microbiota and the related Trp pathway in MDD. Alterations of the gut microbiota may have the potential as biomarkers for distinguishing MDD patients form HCs.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Gene identification / Biomarker","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Health & Disease
524,2019,Characterization of antibiotic resistance genes in the species of the rumen microbiota,"Infections caused by multidrug resistant bacteria represent a therapeutic challenge both in clinical settings and in livestock production, but the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes among the species of bacteria that colonize the gastrointestinal tract of ruminants is not well characterized. Here, we investigate the resistome of 435 ruminal microbial genomes in silico and confirm representative phenotypes in vitro. We find a high abundance of genes encoding tetracycline resistance and evidence that the tet(W) gene is under positive selective pressure. Our findings reveal that tet(W) is located in a novel integrative and conjugative element in several ruminal bacterial genomes. Analyses of rumen microbial metatranscriptomes confirm the expression of the most abundant antibiotic resistance genes. Our data provide insight into antibiotic resistange gene profiles of the main species of ruminal bacteria and reveal the potential role of mobile genetic elements in shaping the resistome of the rumen microbiome, with implications for human and animal health. Here, the authors combine in silico analysis of 435 genomes of ruminal bacteria and archaea with transcriptomics and in vitro assays to investigate the distribution, expression and mobility of antibiotic resistance genes within the ruminal microbiota, finding that the tet(W) gene is under positive selective pressure.","Bacteria, Archaea, Microbiome",AMR,"(Meta)genomics, (Meta)transcriptomics, Metatranscriptomics",Health & Disease
525,2019,Of microbes and mange: consistent changes in the skin microbiome of three canid species infected with Sarcoptes scabiei mites,"Sarcoptic mange is a highly contagious skin disease caused by the ectoparasitic mite Sarcoptes scabiei. Although it afflicts over 100 mammal species worldwide, sarcoptic mange remains a disease obscured by variability at the individual, population and species levels. Amid this variability, it is critical to identify consistent drivers of morbidity, particularly at the skin barrier. Using culture-independent next generation sequencing, we characterized the skin microbiome of three species of North American canids: coyotes (Canis latrans), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus). We compared alpha and beta diversity between mange-infected and uninfected canids using the Kruskal–Wallis test and multivariate analysis of variance with permutation. We used analysis of composition of microbes and gneiss balances to perform differential abundance testing between infection groups. We found remarkably consistent signatures of microbial dysbiosis associated with mange infection. Across genera, mange-infected canids exhibited reduced microbial diversity, altered community composition and increased abundance of opportunistic pathogens. The primary bacteria comprising secondary infections were Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, previously associated with canid ear and skin infections, and Corynebacterium spp., previously found among the gut flora of S. scabiei mites and hematophagous arthropods. This evidence suggests that sarcoptic mange infection consistently alters the canid skin microbiome and facilitates secondary bacterial infection, as seen in humans and other mammals infected with S. scabiei mites. These results provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of mange at the skin barrier of North American canids and can inspire novel treatment strategies. By adopting a “One Health” framework that considers mites, microbes and the potential for interspecies transmission, we can better elucidate the patterns and processes underlying this ubiquitous and enigmatic disease.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen",Community (taxonomy) profiling,,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
526,2019,Characterization of Salmonella Dublin isolated from bovine and human hosts,"Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Dublin (S. Dublin), a cattle adapted serovar causes enteritis, and systemic disease in bovines. The invasive index of this serovar far exceeds that of the other serovars and human infections often present as fatal or highly resistant infections. In this, observational study, phenotypic properties of human and bovine-derived isolates of S. Dublin along with antibiogram of common antimicrobials were evaluated. The multiplex PCR confirmed isolates were genotyped using 7-gene legacy MLST. MIC assay was done by broth microdilution method. Previously published protocols were used to assess the motility, biofilm formation and morphotype. Vi antigen was agglutinated using commercial antiserum. Caenorhabditis elegans infection model was used to evaluate the virulence potiential. Phenotyping experiments were done in duplicates while virulence assay was done in triplicates. Whole-genome sequencing was used to predict the genes responsible for acquired resistance and a genotype-phenotype comparison was made. We evaluated 96 bovine and 10 human isolates in this study. All the isolates belonged to ST10 in eBG53 and were negative for Vi-antigen. The swarming motility, biofilm formation and morphotype were variable in the isolates of both groups. Resistance to sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline was > 90% in animal isolates whereas resistance to sulfamethoxazole was > 70% in human isolates. MDR was also higher in animal isolates. Human isolates were significantly (P < 0.0001) more virulent than animal isolates on C. elegans infection model. The genomic comparison based on the core SNPs showed a high degree of homogeneity between the isolates. The carriage of IncA/C2 plasmid was seen as a typical feature of isolates from the bovine hosts. Human isolates showed more diversity in the phenotypic assays. Animal isolates showed a higher degree of antimicrobial resistance with greater MDR but human isolates formed more biofilm and had greater swarming motility as well as increased virulence to the nematode C. elegans. The carriage of IncA/C2 plasmid could contribute to the distinguishing feature of the bovine isolates. The tandem use of genotypic-phenotypic assays improves the understanding of diversity and differential behaviour of the same serovar from unrelated host sources.",,"Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR, SNP, (M)LST",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
527,2019,Conditional knockout of RAD51-related genes in Leishmania major reveals a critical role for homologous recombination during genome replication,"Homologous recombination (HR) has an intimate relationship with genome replication, both during repair of DNA lesions that might prevent DNA synthesis and in tackling stalls to the replication fork. Recent studies led us to ask if HR might have a more central role in replicating the genome of Leishmania, a eukaryotic parasite. Conflicting evidence has emerged regarding whether or not HR genes are essential, and genome-wide mapping has provided evidence for an unorthodox organisation of DNA replication initiation sites, termed origins. To answer this question, we have employed a combined CRISPR/Cas9 and DiCre approach to rapidly generate and assess the effect of conditional ablation of RAD51 and three RAD51-related proteins in Leishmania major. Using this approach, we demonstrate that loss of any of these HR factors is not immediately lethal, but in each case growth slows with time and leads to DNA damage, accumulation of cells with aberrant DNA content, and genome-wide mutation. Despite these similarities, we show that only loss of RAD51 and RAD51-3 impairs DNA synthesis, and that the factors act in distinct ways. Finally, we reveal that loss of RAD51 has a profound effect on DNA replication, causing loss of initiation at the major origins and increased DNA synthesis at subtelomeres. Our work clarifies questions regarding the importance of HR to survival of Leishmania and reveals an unanticipated, central role for RAD51 in the programme of genome replication in a microbial eukaryote.",Eukaryote,,(Meta)genomics,
528,2019,Expansion of Imaginal Disc Growth Factor Gene Family in Diptera Reflects the Evolution of Novel Functions,"Imaginal disc growth factors (IDGFs) are a small protein family found in insects. They are related to chitinases and implicated in multiple functions, including cell growth stimulation, antimicrobial activity, insect hemolymph clotting, and maintenance of the extracellular matrix. A number of new IDGFs have been found in several insect species and their detailed phylogenetic analysis provides a good basis for further functional studies. To achieve this goal, we sequenced Idgf cDNAs from several lepidopteran and trichopteran species and supplemented our data with sequences retrieved from public databases. A comparison of Idgf genes in different species showed that Diptera typically contain several Idgf paralogs with a simple exon-intron structure (2–3 exons), whereas lepidopteran Idgfs appear as a single copy per genome and contain a higher number of exons (around 9). Our results show that, while lepidopteran Idgfs, having single orthologs, are characterized by low divergence and stronger purifying selection over most of the molecule, the duplicated Idgf genes in Diptera, Idgf1 and Idgf4, exhibit signs of positive selection. This characterization of IDGF evolution provides, to our knowledge, the first information on the changes that formed these important molecules.",,"Functional analysis, AMR",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease

530,2019,Impact of a Nomadic Pastoral Lifestyle on the Gut Microbiome in the Fulani Living in Nigeria,"The co-evolution of the gut microbiota with its human host has revolutionized our current scientific viewpoint about the contribution of diet and lifestyle on human health. Most studies so far have focused on populations living in the United States and Europe or compared those with communities from other geographic areas in the world. In order to determine the taxonomic and predicted functional profile of the gut microbiome of a hitherto unstudied human community, we investigated the phylogenetic diversity of the gut microbiota in a community of Fulani nomadic pastoralists, and their semi-urbanized neighbors – the Jarawa. The Jarawa reside in a city (Jos) in the north-central part of Nigeria, and are adapted in part to a westernized lifestyle. The nomadic Fulani lifestyle resembles a mix of Paleolithic and Neolithic lifestyle patterns with a greater predisposition to diseases. The fecal microbiota of the Fulani and the Jarawa were characterized by paired-end Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, followed by downstream bioinformatics analysis of the sequence reads. The Fulani harbored increased numbers of signatures of microbes that are known to be associated with a foraging lifestyle such as the Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes, and Prevotellaceae, while the Jarawa were dominated by signatures of Firmicutes, Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Christensenellaceae. Notably, the gut microbiota of the Fulani showed less taxonomic diversity than those of the Jarawa. Although they reside in the same geographical zone, microbial community composition was significantly different between the two groups. Pathogens were predicted to be more abundant in the gut microbiota of the Fulani than of the Jarawa. Predicted pathogenic pathways and pathways associated with the breakdown of fiber-rich diet were enriched in the Fulani, including glutathione metabolism, while pathways associated with the consumption of low-fiber diet and xenobiotics, including fructose and mannose metabolic pathways, and nitrotoluene degradation pathways, respectively, were enriched in the Jarawa. Significant differences in composition between both groups were likely due to differences in diet and lifestyle and exposure to pathogens. These results suggest that microbial diversity may not always be higher in non-industrialized societies than in westernized societies, as previously assumed.","Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis",Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
531,2019,Tracking infection dynamics at single-cell level reveals highly resolved expression programs of a large virus infecting algal blooms,"Nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses have the largest genomes among all viruses and infect diverse eukaryotes across various ecosystems, but their expression regulation and infection strategies are not well understood. We profiled single-cell transcriptomes of the worldwide-distributed microalga Emiliania huxleyi and its specific coccolithovirus responsible for massive bloom demise. Heterogeneity in viral transcript levels detected among single cells was used to reconstruct the viral transcriptional trajectory and to map cells along a continuum of infection states. This enabled identification of novel viral genetic programs, which are composed of five kinetic classes with distinct promoter elements. The infection substantially changed the host transcriptome, causing rapid shutdown of protein-encoding nuclear transcripts at the onset of infection, while the plastid and mitochondrial transcriptomes persisted to mid- and late stages, respectively. Single-cell transcriptomics thereby opens the way for tracking host-pathogen infection dynamics at high resolution within microbial communities in the marine environment.","Virus, Eukaryote, Microbiome, Pathogen",Community (taxonomy) profiling,"(Meta)genomics, (Meta)transcriptomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
532,2019,Fecal Transplant in Children With Clostridioides difficile Gives Sustained Reduction in Antimicrobial Resistance and Potential Pathogen Burden,"Abstract Background Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) treats Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Little is known regarding the changes in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and potential pathogen burden that occur in pediatric recipients of FMT. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in AMR genes, potential pathogens, species, and functional pathways with FMT in children. Methods Nine children with recurrent CDI underwent FMT. Stool was collected from donor and recipient pre-FMT and longitudinally post-FMT for up to 24 weeks. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed. Reads were analyzed using PathoScope 2.0. Results All children had resolution of CDI. AMR genes decreased post-FMT (P < .001), with a sustained decrease in multidrug resistance genes (P < .001). Tetracycline resistance genes increased post-FMT (P < .001). Very low levels of potential pathogens were identified in donors and recipients, with an overall decrease post-FMT (P < .001). Prevotella sp. 109 expanded in all recipients post-FMT, and no recipients had any clinical infection. Alpha diversity was lower in recipients vs donors pre-FMT (P < .001), with an increase post-FMT (P ≤ .002) that was sustained. Beta diversity differed significantly in pre- vs post-FMT recipient samples (P < .001). Bacterial species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bacteroides ovatus showed higher abundance in donors than recipients (P = .008 and P = .040, respectively), with expansion post-FMT. Biosynthetic pathways predominated in the donor and increased in the recipient post-FMT. Conclusions FMT for CDI in children decreases AMR genes and potential pathogens and changes microbiota composition and function. However, acquisition of certain AMR genes post-FMT combined with low levels of potential pathogens found in donors suggests that further study is warranted regarding screening donors using metagenomics sequencing before FMT.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, AMR","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

534,2019,The quorum sensing transcription factor AphA directly regulates natural competence in Vibrio cholerae,"Many bacteria use population density to control gene expression via quorum sensing. In Vibrio cholerae, quorum sensing coordinates virulence, biofilm formation, and DNA uptake by natural competence. The transcription factors AphA and HapR, expressed at low- and high-cell density respectively, play a key role. In particular, AphA triggers the entire virulence cascade upon host colonisation. In this work we have mapped genome-wide DNA binding by AphA. We show that AphA is versatile, exhibiting distinct modes of DNA binding and promoter regulation. Unexpectedly, whilst HapR is known to induce natural competence, we demonstrate that AphA also intervenes. Most notably, AphA is a direct repressor of tfoX, the master activator of competence. Hence, production of AphA markedly suppressed DNA uptake; an effect largely circumvented by ectopic expression of tfoX. Our observations suggest dual regulation of competence. At low cell density AphA is a master repressor whilst HapR activates the process at high cell density. Thus, we provide deep mechanistic insight into the role of AphA and highlight how V. cholerae utilises this regulator for diverse purposes. AUTHOR SUMMARY Cholera remains a devastating diarrhoeal disease responsible for millions of cases, thousands of deaths, and a $3 billion financial burden every year. Although notorious for causing human disease, the microorganism responsible for cholera is predominantly a resident of aquatic environments. Here, the organism survives in densely packed communities on the surfaces of crustaceans. Remarkably, in this situation, the microbe can feast on neighbouring cells and acquire their DNA. This provides a useful food source and an opportunity to obtain new genetic information. In this paper, we have investigated how acquisition of DNA from the local environment is regulated. We show that a “switch” within the microbial cell, known to activate disease processes in the human host, also controls DNA uptake. Our results explain why DNA scavenging only occurs in suitable environments and illustrates how interactions between common regulatory switches affords precise control of microbial behaviours.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Interactome",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
535,2019,"The association between gut microbiota composition and BMI in Chinese male college students, as analysed by next-generation sequencing","Abstract Altered gut microbial ecology contributes to the development of metabolic diseases including obesity. However, studies based on different populations have generated conflicting results due to diet, environment, methodologies, etc. The aim of our study was to explore the association between gut microbiota and BMI in Chinese college students. The 16S next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to test the gut microbiota of nine lean, nine overweight/obesity and ten normal-weight male college students. The differences in gut microbiota distribution among three groups were compared, and the relationship between the richness, diversity, composition of gut microbiota and BMI were analysed. The predominant phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were further confirmed by real-time PCR. Metagenomic biomarker discovery was conducted by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe). NGS revealed that gut microbiota composition was different among three groups, but there was no difference in the abundance ratio of Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes. Several bacterial taxa were in linear relationship with BMI (positive relationship: uncultured bacterium (Bacteroides genus); negative relationship: Porphyromonadaceae, Acidaminococcaceae, Rikenellaceae, Desulfovibrionaceae, Blautia, Anaerotruncus, Parabacteroides, Alistipes). Moreover, gut microbiota diversity decreased with the increase in BMI. And LEfSe analysis indicated that Blautia, Anaerotruncus and its uncultured species were significantly enriched in the lean group (LDA score ≥ 3), Parasuterella and its uncultured species were significantly enriched in the overweight/obese groups (LDA score ≥ 3). In general, gut microbiota composition and microbial diversity were associated with BMI in Chinese male college students. Our results might enrich the understanding between gut microbiota and obesity.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Gene identification / Biomarker","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
536,2019,A general framework for quantitatively assessing ecological stochasticity,"Significance An ecological community is a dynamic complex system with a myriad of interacting species, which are controlled by various scale-dependent deterministic and stochastic forces. With rapid advances in genomics technologies, categorizing biological diversity, particularly microbial diversity, becomes relatively easy, but the great challenge is to disentangle the mechanisms controlling biological diversity. The general null model-based framework developed in this study provides an effective and robust tool to ecologists for quantitatively assessing ecological stochasticity. By highlighting the caveats such as model selection, similarity metrics, and spatial scales, this study provides guidance for appropriate use of null model-based approaches for examining community assembly processes. Although this framework was tested with microbial data, it should also be applicable to plant and animal ecology. Understanding the community assembly mechanisms controlling biodiversity patterns is a central issue in ecology. Although it is generally accepted that both deterministic and stochastic processes play important roles in community assembly, quantifying their relative importance is challenging. Here we propose a general mathematical framework to quantify ecological stochasticity under different situations in which deterministic factors drive the communities more similar or dissimilar than null expectation. An index, normalized stochasticity ratio (NST), was developed with 50% as the boundary point between more deterministic (<50%) and more stochastic (>50%) assembly. NST was tested with simulated communities by considering abiotic filtering, competition, environmental noise, and spatial scales. All tested approaches showed limited performance at large spatial scales or under very high environmental noise. However, in all of the other simulated scenarios, NST showed high accuracy (0.90 to 1.00) and precision (0.91 to 0.99), with averages of 0.37 higher accuracy (0.1 to 0.7) and 0.33 higher precision (0.0 to 1.8) than previous approaches. NST was also applied to estimate stochasticity in the succession of a groundwater microbial community in response to organic carbon (vegetable oil) injection. Our results showed that community assembly was shifted from more deterministic (NST = 21%) to more stochastic (NST = 70%) right after organic carbon input. As the vegetable oil was consumed, the community gradually returned to be more deterministic (NST = 27%). In addition, our results demonstrated that null model algorithms and community similarity metrics had strong effects on quantifying ecological stochasticity.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, MAGs",(Meta)genomics,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
537,2019,Microbial Diversity in Bulk and Rhizosphere Soil of Ranunculus glacialis Along a High-Alpine Altitudinal Gradient,"Serving as “natural laboratories”, altitudinal gradients can be used to study changes in the distribution of microorganisms in response to changing environmental conditions that typically occur over short geographical distances. Besides, rhizosphere zones of plants are known to be hot-spots for microbial diversity and to contain different microbial communities when compared with surrounding bulk soil. To discriminate the effects of altitude and plants, we investigated the microbial communities in the rhizosphere of Ranunculus glacialis and bulk soil along a high-alpine altitudinal gradient (2,600–3,400 m a.s.l.). The research area of this study was Mount (Mt.) “Schrankogel” in the Central Alps of Tyrol (Austria). Our results point to significantly different microbial diversities and community compositions in the different altitudinal belts. In the case of prokaryotes, environmental parameters could explain 41% of the total variation of soil communities, with pH and temperature being the strongest influencing factors. Comparing the effects derived from fraction (bulk vs. rhizosphere soil) and environmental factors, the effects of the roots of R. glacialis accounted for about one third of the explained variation. Fungal communities on the other hand were nearly exclusively influenced by environmental parameters accounting for 37.4% of the total variation. Both, for altitudinal zones as well as for bulk and rhizosphere fractions a couple of very specific biomarker taxa could be identified. Generally, the patterns of abundance of several taxa did not follow a steady increased or decreased trend along the altitudinal gradient but in many cases a maximal or minimal occurrence was established at mid-altitudes (3,000–3,100 m). This mid-altitudinal zone is a transition zone (the so-called alpine-nival ecotone) between the (lower) alpine grassland/tundra zone and the (upper) sparsely vegetated nival zone and was shown to correspond with the summer snow line. Climate change and the associated increase in temperature will shift this transition zone and thus, might also shift the described microbial patterns and biomarkers.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Gene identification / Biomarker",,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

The most common serovar isolated from chicken meat was Salmonella enterica serovar Agona of ST13 (n = 16), in contrast to Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis of ST11 (n = 21) in human. Salmonella enterica serovar Corvallis is the only serovar that was overlapping between human and chicken meat. The level of agreement between serotyping and serotype prediction results was 100%. Among the 33 chicken isolates, multidrug resistance (MDR) was observed in five isolates, including two Salmonella enterica serovar Kentucky ST314, which harbored six different classes of AMR determinants. Among the 40 human isolates, MDR was detected in two Salmonella enterica serovar Chester (ST2063) isolates containing five different antibiotic classes of AMR determinants. Out of 73 isolates, the only human Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain of ST36 was found to possess extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) gene, blaCTX-M-15, and it was positive for ESBL production. In summary, this study identified S. enterica serovars that were dominating in chicken meat and human and showed the genomic differences among the chicken meat and human strains. It should be noted that the limited number of isolates and sampling at a different time period means that thorough source attribution is not possible. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the use of whole-genome sequencing analysis of nontyphoidal S. enterica isolated from chicken meat and human in Sri Lanka.",,"Isolate, AMR",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease

540,2019,"Complex Bacterial Consortia Reprogram the Colitogenic Activity of Enterococcus faecalis in a Gnotobiotic Mouse Model of Chronic, Immune-Mediated Colitis","Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are associated with compositional and functional changes of the intestinal microbiota, but specific contributions of individual bacteria to chronic intestinal inflammation remain unclear. Enterococcus faecalis is a resident member of the human intestinal core microbiota that has been linked to the pathogenesis of IBD and induces chronic colitis in susceptible monoassociated IL-10-deficient (IL-10−/−) mice. In this study, we characterized the colitogenic activity of E. faecalis as part of a simplified human microbial consortium based on seven enteric bacterial strains (SIHUMI). RNA sequencing analysis of E. faecalis isolated from monoassociated wild type and IL-10−/− mice identified 408 genes including 14 genes of the ethanolamine utilization (eut) locus that were significantly up-regulated in response to inflammation. Despite considerable up-regulation of eut genes, deletion of ethanolamine utilization (ΔeutVW) had no impact on E. faecalis colitogenic activity in monoassociated IL-10−/− mice. However, replacement of the E. faecalis wild type bacteria by a ΔeutVW mutant in SIHUMI-colonized IL-10−/− mice resulted in exacerbated colitis, suggesting protective functions of E. faecalis ethanolamine utilization in complex bacterial communities. To better understand E. faecalis gene response in the presence of other microbes, we purified wild type E. faecalis cells from the colon content of SIHUMI-colonized wild type and IL-10−/− mice using immuno-magnetic separation and performed RNA sequencing. Transcriptional profiling revealed that the bacterial environment reprograms E. faecalis gene expression in response to inflammation, with the majority of differentially expressed genes not being shared between monocolonized and SIHUMI conditions. While in E. faecalis monoassociation a general bacterial stress response could be observed, expression of E. faecalis genes in SIHUMI-colonized mice was characterized by up-regulation of genes involved in growth and replication. Interestingly, in mice colonized with SIHUMI lacking E. faecalis enhanced inflammation was observed in comparison to SIHUMI-colonized mice, supporting the hypothesis that E. faecalis ethanolamine metabolism protects against colitis in complex consortia. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that complex bacterial consortia interactions reprogram the gene expression profile and colitogenic activity of the opportunistic pathogen E. faecalis toward a protective function.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome",,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
541,2019,Epithelium intrinsic vitamin A signaling co-ordinates pathogen clearance in the gut via IL-18,"Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are at the forefront of host-pathogen interactions, coordinating a cascade of immune responses to confer protection against pathogens. Here we show that IEC-intrinsic vitamin A signaling restricts pathogen invasion early in the infection and subsequently activates immune cells to promote pathogen clearance. Mice blocked for retinoic acid receptor (RAR) signaling selectively in IECs (stopΔIEC) showed significantly higher Salmonella burden in colonic tissues early in the infection associated with higher luminal and systemic loads of the pathogen at later stages. Higher susceptibility of stopΔIEC mice correlated with attenuated mucosal interferon gamma (IFNγ) production by underlying immune cells. We found that, at homeostasis, the intestinal epithelium of stopΔIEC mice produced significantly lower amounts of interleukin 18 (IL-18), a potent inducer of IFNγ. Regulation of IL-18 by vitamin A was also observed in a dietary model of vitamin A supplementation. IL-18 reconstitution in stopΔIEC mice restored resistance to Salmonella by promoting epithelial cell shedding to eliminate infected cells and limit pathogen invasion early in infection. Further, IL-18 augmented IFNγ production by underlying immune cells to restrict pathogen burden and systemic spread. Our work uncovers a critical role for vitamin A in coordinating a biphasic immune response to Salmonella infection by regulating IL-18 production by IECs. Author Summary Epithelial cells line the intestinal lumen, forming a barrier between the body and dietary and microbial contents in the lumen. Apart from absorbing nutrients from diet, these epithelial cells help mediate a stable, symbiotic relationship between microbes in the gut and the immune cells. During infection, they help co-ordinate the immune response to counter the infection. How dietary micronutrients, such as vitamin A, inform epithelial cell function during infection is poorly understood. Using a model where epithelial cells in the gut cannot respond to vitamin A signals, we find that epithelial vitamin A signaling promotes resistance to Salmonella infection. We show that, vitamin A increases the production of a key cytokine, interleukin 18, by epithelial cells. IL-18 promotes shedding of infected epithelial cells to reduce the pathogen invasion while also inducing the production of interferon gamma by immune cells to mediate pathogen clearance. Thus, epithelial cells dynamically respond to dietary vitamin A to regulate interleukin 18 production and potentiate resistance to infection.",Pathogen,"Functional analysis, Interactome, AMR",,Health & Disease
542,2019,CReasPy-cloning: a method for simultaneous cloning and engineering of megabase-sized genomes in yeast using the CRISPR-Cas9 system,"Over the last decade a new strategy was developed to bypass the difficulties to genetically engineer some microbial species by transferring (or “cloning”) their genome into another organism that is amenable to efficient genetic modifications and therefore acts as a living workbench. As such, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used to clone and engineer genomes from viruses, bacteria and algae. The cloning step requires the insertion of yeast genetic elements within the genome of interest, in order to drive its replication and maintenance as an artificial chromosome in the host cell. Current methods used to introduce these genetic elements are still unsatisfactory, due either to their random nature (transposon) or the requirement for unique restriction sites at specific positions (TAR cloning). Here we describe the CReasPy-Cloning, a new method that combines both the ability of Cas9 to cleave DNA at a user-specified locus and the yeast’s highly efficient homologous recombination to simultaneously clone and engineer a bacterial chromosome in yeast. Using the 0.816 Mbp genome of Mycoplasma pneumoniae as a proof of concept, we demonstrate that our method can be used to introduce the yeast genetic element at any location in the bacterial chromosome while simultaneously deleting various genes or group of genes. We also show that CReasPy-cloning can be used to edit up to three independent genomic loci at the same time with an efficiency high enough to warrant the screening of a small (<50) number of clones, allowing for significantly shortened genome engineering cycle times.","Bacteria, Virus",,(Meta)genomics,
543,2019,Microbial iron metabolism as revealed by gene expression profiles in contrasted Southern Ocean regimes,"Summary Iron (Fe) is a limiting nutrient in large regions of the ocean, but the strategies of prokaryotes to cope with this micronutrient are poorly known. Using a gene‐specific approach from metatranscriptomics data, we investigated seven Fe‐related metabolic pathways in microbial communities from high nutrient low chlorophyll and naturally Fe‐fertilized waters in the Southern Ocean. We observed major differences in the contribution of prokaryotic groups at different taxonomic levels to transcripts encoding Fe‐uptake mechanisms, intracellular Fe storage and replacement and Fe‐related pathways in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The composition of the prokaryotic communities contributing to the transcripts of a given Fe‐related pathway was overall independent of the in situ Fe supply, indicating that microbial taxa utilize distinct Fe‐related metabolic processes. Only a few prokaryotic groups contributed to the transcripts of more than one Fe‐uptake mechanism, suggesting limited metabolic versatility. Taxa‐specific expression of individual genes varied among prokaryotic groups and was substantially higher for all inspected genes in Fe‐limited as compared to naturally fertilized waters, indicating the link between transcriptional state and Fe regime. Different metabolic strategies regarding low Fe concentrations in the Southern Ocean are discussed for two abundant prokaryotic groups, Pelagibacteraceae and Flavobacteriaceae.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,"(Meta)transcriptomics, Metatranscriptomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

Necropsies were performed in 22 cases and infectious diseases resulted the most common cause of death. Three striped dolphins, showed a severe coinfection involving the monophasic variant of Salmonella Typhimurium (Salmonella 1,4,[5],12:i:-). The isolates were characterized based on antimicrobial resistance, Multiple-Locus Variable-number tandem-repeat Analysis (MLVA) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). All isolates demonstrated the same multidrug resistant genotype (ASSuT isolates), showed three different MLVA profiles, two of which closely related, and were identified as Sequence Type 34. Moreover, Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) analysis confirmed strong correlations between two out of the three isolates. To our knowledge, S. 1,4,[5],12:i:-, one of the most common serovars in cases of human infection and food sources worldwide, has not previously been described in marine mammals, and reports of Salmonella-associated disease in free-ranging cetaceans are rare. These results highlight the role of cetaceans as sentinel species for zoonotic and terrestrial pathogens in the marine environment, suggest a potential risk for cetaceans and public health along the North Western Italian coastline and indicate cetaceans as a novel potential reservoir for one of the most widespread Salmonella serovars.",Pathogen,"Isolate, AMR, SNP, Variant",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
545,2019,Linking soil's volatilome to microbes and plant roots highlights the importance of microbes as emitters of belowground volatile signals.,"Plants and microbes release a plethora of volatiles that act as signals in plant-microbe interactions. Characterizing soil's volatilome and microbiome might shed light on the nature of relevant volatile signals and on their emitters. This hypothesis was tested by characterizing plant cover, soil's volatilome, nutrient content and microbiomes in three grasslands of the Swiss Jura Mountains. The fingerprints of soil's volatiles were generated by solid-phase micro-extraction gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, whereas high-throughput sequencing was used to create a snapshot of soil's microbial communities. A high similarity was observed in plant communities of two out of three sites, which was mirrored by the soil's volatilome. Multiple factor analysis evidenced a strong association among soil's volatilome, plant and microbial communities. The proportion of volatiles correlated to single bacterial and fungal taxa was higher than for plants. This suggests that those organisms might be major contributors to the volatilome of grassland soils. These findings illustrate that key volatiles in grassland soils might be emitted by a handful of organisms that include specific plants and microbes. Further work will be needed to unravel the structure of belowground volatiles and understand their implications for plant health and development.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Interactome",(Meta)proteomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
546,2019,Influence of Urbanization on Epiphytic Bacterial Communities of the Platanus × hispanica Tree Leaves in a Biennial Study,"The aerial surfaces of plants harbor diverse communities of microorganisms. The rising awareness concerning the potential roles of these phyllosphere microbiota for airborne pollutant remediation and plant growth promotion, advocates for a better understanding of their community structure and dynamics in urban ecosystems. Here, we characterized the epiphytic microbial communities on leaves of Platanus × hispanica trees in the city centre of Hasselt (Belgium), and the nearby forest area of Bokrijk, Genk (Belgium). We compared the influences of season, site, and air pollutants concentration variations on the tree’s phyllosphere microbiome by determining the intra- and inter-individual variation in leaf bacterial communities. High-throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed large variation in the bacterial community structure and diversity throughout the years but also allowed to discriminate an environment effect on community assembly. Partial drivers for this environment effect on composition can be correlated with the huge differences in ultrafine particulate matter (UFP) and black carbon on the leaves. A change in bacterial community composition was noted for trees growing in the city center compared to the natural site, and also more human-associated genera were found colonizing the leaves from the city center. These integrated results offer an original and first insight in the Platanus phyllomicrobiota, which can offer new opportunities to use phyllosphere microorganisms to enhance air pollution degradation.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, MAGs",Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

548,2019,Validation of a Bioinformatics Workflow for Routine Analysis of Whole-Genome Sequencing Data and Related Challenges for Pathogen Typing in a European National Reference Center: Neisseria meningitidis as a Proof-of-Concept,"Despite being a well-established research method, the use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for routine molecular typing and pathogen characterization remains a substantial challenge due to the required bioinformatics resources and/or expertise. Moreover, many national reference laboratories and centers, as well as other laboratories working under a quality system, require extensive validation to demonstrate that employed methods are “fit-for-purpose” and provide high-quality results. A harmonized framework with guidelines for the validation of WGS workflows does currently, however, not exist yet, despite several recent case studies highlighting the urgent need thereof. We present a validation strategy focusing specifically on the exhaustive characterization of the bioinformatics analysis of a WGS workflow designed to replace conventionally employed molecular typing methods for microbial isolates in a representative small-scale laboratory, using the pathogen Neisseria meningitidis as a proof-of-concept. We adapted several classically employed performance metrics specifically toward three different bioinformatics assays: resistance gene characterization (based on the ARG-ANNOT, ResFinder, CARD, and NDARO databases), several commonly employed typing schemas (including, among others, core genome multilocus sequence typing), and serogroup determination. We analyzed a core validation dataset of 67 well-characterized samples typed by means of classical genotypic and/or phenotypic methods that were sequenced in-house, allowing to evaluate repeatability, reproducibility, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity of the different bioinformatics assays. We also analyzed an extended validation dataset composed of publicly available WGS data for 64 samples by comparing results of the different bioinformatics assays against results obtained from commonly used bioinformatics tools. We demonstrate high performance, with values for all performance metrics >87%, >97%, and >90% for the resistance gene characterization, sequence typing, and serogroup determination assays, respectively, for both validation datasets. Our WGS workflow has been made publicly available as a “push-button” pipeline for Illumina data at https://galaxy.sciensano.be to showcase its implementation for non-profit and/or academic usage.

549,2018,MetaFlow: an interactive user-friendly workflow for automated analysis of whole genome shotgun sequencing metagenomic data,"Metagenomics is a rapidly emerging field that is concerned with the study of microbial communities “microbiomes” on both levels of taxonomic classification and functional annotation. Targeted amplicon (16S rRNA) and whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing are the two main sequencing strategies in metagenomics. As amplicon sequencing provides a cheap way to classify the composition of a microbial community, it lacks the ability to identify microbial genes and annotate its corresponding functions. On the other hand, WGS sequencing allows further investigation of the complete genomes with all associated genetic information, and hence, gives another dimension for functional analysis, however, these mentioned advantages are not in favor of sequencing cost, duration of the analysis, and required computational resources. Currently, most tools for WGS microbiome data analysis are commandline based, which limits its use to only experienced bioinformaticians, due to its complexity during installation, usage and fine tuning numerous parameters. Moreover, current tools required for different steps of microbiome data analysis are platform specific and not user-friendly for biologists without previous deep knowledge in command line and installation/configuration troubleshooting abilities. In this paper, we present MetaFlow; a comprehensive automatic platform-independent workflow with a friendly graphical user interface (GUI), for interactive analysis of shotgun metagenomic data. MetaFlow will facilitate the analysis of WGS metagenomic data on a personal laptop, more smoothly, rapidly in an automatic, comprehensive and interactive way for biologists and microbiologists.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Annotation","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",
550,2018,Impacts of Diet and Exercise on Maternal Gut Microbiota Are Transferred to Offspring,"Background: It is well established that maternal exercise during pregnancy improves metabolic outcomes associated with obesity in mothers and offspring, however, its effects on the gut microbiota of both mother and offspring, are unknown. Here, we investigated whether wheel running exercise prior to and during pregnancy and prolonged feeding of an obesogenic diet were associated with changes in the gut microbiomes of Sprague-Dawley rat dams and their offspring. Female rats were fed either chow or obesogenic diet, and half of each diet group were given access to a running wheel 10 days before mating until delivery, while others remained sedentary. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was used to assess gut microbial communities in dams and their male and female offspring around the time of weaning. Results: Statistical analyses at the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) level revealed that maternal obesogenic diet decreased gut microbial alpha diversity and altered abundances of bacterial taxa previously associated with obesity such as Bacteroides and Blautia in dams, and their offspring of both sexes. Distance based linear modeling revealed that the relative abundances of Bacteroides OTUs were associated with adiposity measures in both dams and offspring. We identified no marked effects of maternal exercise on the gut microbiota of obesogenic diet dams or their offspring. In contrast, maternal exercise decreased gut microbial alpha diversity and altered the abundance of 88 microbial taxa in offspring of control dams. Thirty of these taxa were altered in a similar direction in offspring of sedentary obesogenic vs. control diet dams. In particular, the relative abundances of Oscillibacter OTUs were decreased in offspring of both exercised control dams and sedentary obesogenic diet dams, and associated with blood glucose concentrations and adiposity measures. Analyses of predicted bacterial metabolic pathways inferred decreased indole alkaloid biosynthesis in offspring of both obesogenic diet and exercised control dams. Conclusions: Our data suggest that maternal exercise prior to and during pregnancy resulted in gut dysbiosis in offspring of control dams. Importantly, alterations in the maternal gut microbiota by obesogenic diet or obesity were transferred to their offspring.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
551,2018,Profiling the airway in the macaque model of tuberculosis reveals variable microbial dysbiosis and alteration of community structure,"The specific interactions of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), and the lung microbiota in infection are entirely unexplored. Studies in cancer and other infectious diseases suggest that there are important exchanges occurring between host and microbiota that influence the immunological landscape. This can result in alterations in immune regulation and inflammation both locally and systemically. To assess whether Mtb infection modifies the lung microbiome, and identify changes in microbial abundance and diversity as a function of pulmonary inflammation, we compared infected and uninfected lung lobe washes collected serially from 26 macaques by bronchoalveolar lavage over the course of infection. We found that Mtb induced an initial increase in lung microbial diversity at 1 month post infection that normalized by 5 months of infection across all macaques. Several core genera showed global shifts from baseline and throughout infection. Moreover, we identified several specific taxa normally associated with the oral microbiome that increased in relative abundance in the lung following Mtb infection, including SR1, Aggregatibacter, Leptotrichia, Prevotella, and Campylobacter. On an individual macaque level, we found significant heterogeneity in both the magnitude and duration of change within the lung microbial community that was unrelated to lung inflammation and lobe involvement as seen by positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging. By comparing microbial interaction networks pre- and post-infection using the predictive algorithm SPIEC-EASI, we observe that extra connections are gained by Actinomycetales, the order containing Mtb, in spite of an overall reduction in the number of interactions of the whole community post-infection, implicating Mtb-driven ecological reorganization within the lung. This study is the first to probe the dynamic interplay between Mtb and host microbiota longitudinally and in the macaque lung. Our findings suggest that Mtb can alter the microbial landscape of infected lung lobes and that these interactions induce dysbiosis that can disrupt oral-airway boundaries, shift overall lung diversity, and modulate specific microbial relationships. We also provide evidence that this effect is heterogeneous across different macaques. Overall, however, the changes to the airway microbiota after Mtb infection were surprisingly modest, despite a range of Mtb-induced pulmonary inflammation in this cohort of macaques.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome",Imaging,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

In 2015, an outbreak marked by high morbidity but low mortality swept through a colony of immunocompromised mice; this outbreak rapidly affected 75% of the colony and ultimately required complete depopulation of the barrier suite. Conventional microbiologic and molecular diagnostics were unsuccessful in determining the cause; therefore, we explored culture-independent methods to broadly profile the microbial community in the feces of affected animals. This approach identified 4 bacterial taxa- Candidatus Arthromitus, Clostridium celatum, Clostridiales bacterium VE202-01, and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum strain PV8-2- that were significantly enriched in the affected mice. Based on these results, specific changes were made to the animal husbandry procedures for immunocompromised mice.

554,2018,Induction of innate immune memory via microRNA targeting of chromatin remodeling factors,"Prolonged exposure to microbial products such as lipopolysaccharide can induce a form of innate immune memory that blunts subsequent responses to unrelated pathogens, known as lipopolysaccharide tolerance. Sepsis is a dysregulated systemic immune response to disseminated infection that has a high mortality rate. In some patients, sepsis results in a period of immunosuppression (known as ‘immunoparalysis’)1 characterized by reduced inflammatory cytokine output2, increased secondary infection3 and an increased risk of organ failure and mortality4. Lipopolysaccharide tolerance recapitulates several key features of sepsis-associated immunosuppression5. Although various epigenetic changes have previously been observed in tolerized macrophages6–8, the molecular basis of tolerance, immunoparalysis and other forms of innate immune memory has remained unclear. Here we perform a screen for tolerance-associated microRNAs and identify miR-221 and miR-222 as regulators of the functional reprogramming of macrophages during lipopolysaccharide tolerization. Prolonged stimulation with lipopolysaccharide in mice leads to increased expression of miR-221 and mir-222, both of which regulate brahma-related gene 1 (Brg1, also known as Smarca4). This increased expression causes the transcriptional silencing of a subset of inflammatory genes that depend on chromatin remodelling mediated by SWI/SNF (switch/sucrose non-fermentable) and STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription), which in turn promotes tolerance. In patients with sepsis, increased expression of miR-221 and miR-222 correlates with immunoparalysis and increased organ damage. Our results show that specific microRNAs can regulate macrophage tolerization and may serve as biomarkers of immunoparalysis and poor prognosis in patients with sepsis. The microRNAs miR-221 and miR-222 regulate the reprogramming of macrophages during the development of lipopolysaccharide tolerance, and increased expression of these microRNAs is associated with immunosuppression and poor prognosis in patients with sepsis.","Virus, Pathogen","Functional analysis, Gene identification / Biomarker",,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
555,2018,Expression of Novel Gene Content Drives Adaptation to Low Iron in the Cyanobacterium Acaryochloris,"Abstract Variation in genome content is a potent mechanism of microbial adaptation. The genomes of members of the cyanobacterial genus Acaryochloris vary greatly in gene content as a consequence of the idiosyncratic retention of both recent gene duplicates and plasmid-encoded genes acquired by horizontal transfer. For example, the genome of Acaryochloris strain MBIC11017, which was isolated from an iron-limited environment, is enriched in duplicated and novel genes involved in iron assimilation. Here, we took an integrative approach to characterize the adaptation of Acaryochloris MBIC11017 to low environmental iron availability and the relative contributions of the expression of duplicated versus novel genes. We observed that Acaryochloris MBIC11017 grew faster and to a higher yield in the presence of nanomolar concentrations of iron than did a closely related strain. These differences were associated with both a higher rate of iron assimilation and a greater abundance of iron assimilation transcripts. However, recently duplicated genes contributed little to increased transcript dosage; rather, the maintenance of these duplicates in the MBIC11017 genome is likely due to the sharing of ancestral dosage by expression reduction. Instead, novel, horizontally transferred genes are responsible for the differences in transcript abundance. The study provides insights on the mechanisms of adaptive genome evolution and gene expression in Acaryochloris.",Bacteria,Isolate,(Meta)genomics,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
556,2018,Diversity and antimicrobial potential in sea anemone and holothurian microbiomes,"Marine invertebrates, as holobionts, contain symbiotic bacteria that coevolve and develop antimicrobial substances. These symbiotic bacteria are an underexplored source of new bioactive molecules to face the emerging antibiotic resistance in pathogens. Here, we explored the antimicrobial activity of bacteria retrieved from the microbiota of two sea anemones (Anemonia sulcata, Actinia equina) and two holothurians (Holothuria tubulosa, Holothuria forskali). We tested the antimicrobial activity of the isolated bacteria against pathogens with interest for human health, agriculture and aquaculture. We isolated 27 strains with antibacterial activity and 12 of these isolates also showed antifungal activity. We taxonomically identified these strains being Bacillus and Vibrio species the most representative producers of antimicrobial substances. Microbiome species composition of the two sea anemones was similar between them but differed substantially of seawater bacteria. In contrast, microbiome species composition of the two holothurian species was different between them and in comparison with the bacteria in holothurian feces and seawater. In all the holobiont microbiomes Bacteroidetes was the predominant phylum. For each microbiome, we determined diversity and the rank-abundance dominance using five fitted models (null, pre-emption, log-Normal, Zipf and Zipf-Mandelbrot). The models with less evenness (i.e. Zipf and Zipf-Mandelblot) showed the best fits in all the microbiomes. Finally, we tracked (using the V4 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA gene) the relative abundance of these 27 isolates with antibacterial activity in the total pool of sequences obtained for the microbiome of each holobiont. Coincidences, although with extremely low frequencies, were detected only in the microbiome of H. forskali. This fact suggests that these isolated bacteria belong to the long tail of rare symbiotic bacteria. Therefore, more and more sophisticated culture techniques are necessary to explore this apparently vast pool of rare symbiontic bacteria and to determine their biotechnological potentiality.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR",Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

The constant flux of host-secreted mucin at the mucosal layer creates a steady niche for bacterial colonization. Mucin degradation by keystone species subsequently shapes the microbial community. This study investigated the transcriptional response during mucin-driven trophic interaction between the specialised mucin-degrader Akkermansia muciniphila and a butyrogenic gut commensal Anaerostipes caccae. A. muciniphila monocultures and co-cultures with non-mucolytic A. caccae from the Lachnospiraceae family were grown anaerobically in minimal media supplemented with mucin. We analysed for growth, metabolites (HPLC analysis), microbial composition (quantitative reverse transcription PCR), and transcriptional response (RNA-seq). Mucin degradation by A. muciniphila supported the growth of A. caccae and concomitant butyrate production predominantly via the acetyl-CoA pathway. Differential expression analysis (DESeq 2) showed the presence of A. caccae induced changes in the A. muciniphila transcriptional response with increased expression of mucin degradation genes and reduced expression of ribosomal genes. Two putative operons that encode for uncharacterised proteins and an efflux system, and several two-component systems were also differentially regulated. This indicated A. muciniphila changed its transcriptional regulation in response to A. caccae. This study provides insight to understand the mucin-driven microbial ecology using metatranscriptomics.

559,2018,Disseminating Metaproteomic Informatics Capabilities and Knowledge Using the Galaxy-P Framework,"The impact of microbial communities, also known as the microbiome, on human health and the environment is receiving increased attention. Studying translated gene products (proteins) and comparing metaproteomic profiles may elucidate how microbiomes respond to specific environmental stimuli, and interact with host organisms. Characterizing proteins expressed by a complex microbiome and interpreting their functional signature requires sophisticated informatics tools and workflows tailored to metaproteomics. Additionally, there is a need to disseminate these informatics resources to researchers undertaking metaproteomic studies, who could use them to make new and important discoveries in microbiome research. The Galaxy for proteomics platform (Galaxy-P) offers an open source, web-based bioinformatics platform for disseminating metaproteomics software and workflows. Within this platform, we have developed easily-accessible and documented metaproteomic software tools and workflows aimed at training researchers in their operation and disseminating the tools for more widespread use. The modular workflows encompass the core requirements of metaproteomic informatics: (a) database generation; (b) peptide spectral matching; (c) taxonomic analysis and (d) functional analysis. Much of the software available via the Galaxy-P platform was selected, packaged and deployed through an online metaproteomics “Contribution Fest“ undertaken by a unique consortium of expert software developers and users from the metaproteomics research community, who have co-authored this manuscript. These resources are documented on GitHub and freely available through the Galaxy Toolshed, as well as a publicly accessible metaproteomics gateway Galaxy instance. These documented workflows are well suited for the training of novice metaproteomics researchers, through online resources such as the Galaxy Training Network, as well as hands-on training workshops. Here, we describe the metaproteomics tools available within these Galaxy-based resources, as well as the process by which they were selected and implemented in our community-based work. We hope this description will increase access to and utilization of metaproteomics tools, as well as offer a framework for continued community-based development and dissemination of cutting edge metaproteomics software.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis","(Meta)proteomics, Metaproteomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
560,2017,Temporal Variation of the Skin Bacterial Community and Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis Infection in the Terrestrial Cryptic Frog Philoria loveridgei,"In animals and plants, symbiotic bacteria can play an important role in disease resistance of host and are the focus of much current research. Globally, amphibian population declines and extinctions have occurred due to chytridiomycosis, a skin disease caused by the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Currently amphibian skin bacteria are increasingly recognized as important symbiont communities with a relevant role in the defense against pathogens, as some bacteria can inhibit the growth of B. dendrobatidis. This study aims to document the B. dendrobatidis infection status of wild populations of a terrestrial cryptic frog (Philoria loveridgei), and to determine whether infection status is correlated with changes in the skin microbial communities. Skin samples of P. loveridgei were collected along an altitudinal range within the species distribution in subtropical rainforests in southeast Australia. Sampling was conducted in two years during two breeding seasons with the first classified as a “La Niña” year. We used Taqman real-time PCR to determine B. dendrobatidis infection status and 16S amplicon sequencing techniques to describe the skin community structure. We found B. dendrobatidis-positive frogs only in the second sampling year with low infection intensities, and no correlation between B. dendrobatidis infection status and altitude, frog sex or size. Skin bacterial diversity was significantly higher in P. loveridgei frogs sampled in the 1st year than in the 2nd year. In addition, 7.4% of the total OTUs were significantly more abundant in the 1st year compared to the 2nd year. We identified 67 bacterial OTUs with a significant positive correlation between infection intensity and an OTU’s relative abundance. Forty-five percent of these OTUs belonged to the family Enterobacteriaceae. Overall, temporal variation was strongly associated with changes in B. dendrobatidis infection status and bacterial community structure of wild populations of P. loveridgei.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR",Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
561,2017,"The primary transcriptome, small RNAs and regulation of antimicrobial resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 17978","We present the first high-resolution determination of transcriptome architecture in the priority pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii. Pooled RNA from 16 laboratory conditions was used for differential RNA-seq (dRNA-seq) to identify 3731 transcriptional start sites (TSS) and 110 small RNAs, including the first identification in A. baumannii of sRNAs encoded at the 3’ end of coding genes. Most sRNAs were conserved among sequenced A. baumannii genomes, but were only weakly conserved or absent in other Acinetobacter species. Single nucleotide mapping of TSS enabled prediction of −10 and −35 RNA polymerase binding sites and revealed an unprecedented base preference at position +2 that hints at an unrecognized transcriptional regulatory mechanism. To apply functional genomics to the problem of antimicrobial resistance, we dissected the transcriptional regulation of the drug efflux pump responsible for chloramphenicol resistance, craA. The two craA promoters were both down-regulated >1000-fold when cells were shifted to nutrient limited medium. This conditional down-regulation of craA expression renders cells sensitive to chloramphenicol, a highly effective antibiotic for the treatment of multidrug resistant infections.

562,2017,Ultra-low input transcriptomics reveal the spore functional content and phylogenetic affiliations of poorly studied arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi,"Abstract Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are a group of soil microorganisms that establish symbioses with the vast majority of land plants. To date, generation of AMF coding information has been limited to model genera that grow well axenically; Rhizoglomus and Gigaspora. Meanwhile, data on the functional gene repertoire of most AMF families is non-existent. Here, we provide primary large-scale transcriptome data from eight poorly studied AMF species (Acaulospora morrowiae, Diversispora versiforme, Scutellospora calospora, Racocetra castanea, Paraglomus brasilianum, Ambispora leptoticha, Claroideoglomus claroideum and Funneliformis mosseae) using ultra-low input ribonucleic acid (RNA)-seq approaches. Our analyses reveals that quiescent spores of many AMF species harbour a diverse functional diversity and solidify known evolutionary relationships within the group. Our findings demonstrate that RNA-seq data obtained from low-input RNA are reliable in comparison to conventional RNA-seq experiments. Thus, our methodology can potentially be used to deepen our understanding of fungal microbial function and phylogeny using minute amounts of RNA material.",,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis",(Meta)transcriptomics,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
563,2017,The Inuit gut microbiome is dynamic over time and shaped by traditional foods,"BackgroundThe human gut microbiome represents a diverse microbial community that varies across individuals and populations, and is influenced by factors such as host genetics and lifestyle. Diet is a major force shaping the gut microbiome, and the effects of dietary choices on microbiome composition are well documented. However, it remains poorly known how natural temporal variation in diet can affect the microbiome. The traditional Inuit diet is primarily based on animal products, which are thought to vary seasonally according to prey availability. We previously investigated the Inuit gut microbiome sampled at a single time point, and found no detectable differences in overall microbiome community composition attributable to the traditional Inuit diet.ResultsTo determine whether seasonal changes in the Inuit diet might induce more pronounced changes in the microbiome, we collected stool and toilet paper samples, and dietary information from Inuit volunteers living in Resolute Bay (Nunavut, Canada), and compared them to individuals of European descent living in Montréal (Québec, Canada) consuming a typical Western diet. We sequenced the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize microbiome diversity and composition, and compared samples collected with toilet paper or from stool. Our results show that these sampling methods provide similar, but non-identical portraits of the microbiome. Based on toilet paper samples, we found that much of the variation in microbiome community composition could be explained by individual identity (45–61% of variation explained, depending on the beta diversity metric used), with small but significant variation (3–5%) explained by sex or geography (Nunavut or Montréal). In contrast with our previous study at one time point, sampling over the course of a year revealed that diet explains 11% of variation in community composition across all participants, and 17% of variation specifically among Nunavut participants. However, we observed no clear seasonal shifts in the microbiomes of participants from either Nunavut or Montréal. Within-individual microbial diversity fluctuated more over time in Nunavut than in Montréal, consistent with a more variable and highly individualized diet in Nunavut.ConclusionsTogether, these results shows that the traditional Inuit diet and lifestyle has an impact on the composition, diversity and stability of the Inuit gut microbiome, even if the seasonality of the diet is less pronounced than expected, perhaps due to an increasingly westernized diet.",Microbiome,Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
564,2017,Sodium butyrate improved performance while modulating the cecal microbiota and regulating the expression of intestinal immune‐related genes of broiler chickens,"ABSTRACT This study evaluated the effect of sodium butyrate (SB) on performance, expression of immune‐related genes in the cecal tonsils, and cecal microbiota of broiler chickens when dietary energy and amino acids concentrations were reduced. Day‐old male Ross 708 broiler chicks were fed dietary treatments in a 3 × 2 factorial design (8 pens per treatment) with 3 dietary formulations (control diet; reduction of 2.3% of amino acids and 60 kcal/kg; and reduction of 4.6% of amino acids and 120 kcal/kg) with or without the inclusion of 0.1% of SB. Feed intake (FI), body weight gain (BW gain), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were recorded until 28 d of age. From 14 to 28 d, there was an interaction of nutrient density by SB (P = 0.003) wherein BW gain of birds fed SB was impaired less by the energy/amino acids reduction than unsupplemented birds. A similar result was obtained from 1 to 28 d (P = 0.004). No interaction (P < 0.05) between nutrient density by SB was observed for FCR. Nutritional density of the diets and SB modified the structure, composition, and predicted function of the cecal microbiota. The nutritionally reduced diet altered the imputed function performed by the microbiota and the SB supplementation reduced these variations, keeping the microbial function similar to that observed in chickens fed a control diet. The frequency of bacterial species presenting the butyryl‐CoA: acetate CoA‐transferase gene increased in the microbiota of chickens fed a nutritionally reduced diet without SB supplementation, and was not changed by nutrient density of the diet when supplemented with SB (interaction; P = 0.01). SB modulated the expression of immune related genes in the cecal tonsils; wherein SB upregulated the expression of A20 in broilers fed control diets (P < 0.05) and increased IL‐6 expression (P < 0.05). These results show that SB had positive effects on the productive performance of broilers fed nutritionally reduced diets, partially by modulating the cecal microbiota and exerting immune‐modulatory effects.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Functional analysis, Interactome",,Health & Disease
565,2017,Metabolic interactions between dynamic bacterial subpopulations,"Within multi-species microbial communities, individual species are known to occupy distinct metabolic niches. By contrast, it has remained largely unclear whether and how metabolic specialization occurs within clonal bacterial populations. The possibility of such metabolic specialization in clonal populations raises several questions: Does specialization occur, and if it does, which metabolic processes are involved? How is specialization coordinated? How rapidly do cells switch between states? And finally, what functions might metabolic specialization provide? One potential function of metabolic specialization could be to manage overflow metabolites such as acetate, which presents a toxic challenge due to low pH, and protective pH-neutral overflow metabolites. Here we show that exponentially dividing Bacillus subtilis cultures divide into distinct interacting metabolic subpopulations including one population that produces acetate, and another population that differentially expresses metabolic genes for the production of acetoin, a pH-neutral storage molecule. These subpopulations grew at distinct rates, and cells switched dynamically between states, with acetate influencing the relative sizes of the different subpopulations. These results show that clonal populations can use metabolic specialization to control the environment through a process of dynamic, environmentally-sensitive state-switching.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome",Metabolomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
566,2017,The Low-Diversity Fecal Microbiota of the Critically Endangered Kākāpō Is Robust to Anthropogenic Dietary and Geographic Influences,"The critically endangered kākāpō, an herbivorous parrot endemic to New Zealand, is subject to intensive management to increase its population size. Key aspects of the management program include supplementary feeding and translocation of kākāpō between different predator-free islands to optimize the genetic composition of the breeding populations. While these practices have helped boost the kākāpō population, their impact on the kākāpō fecal microbiota is uncertain. Previous studies have found that the kākāpō possesses a low-diversity fecal microbiota, typically dominated by Escherichia/Shigella spp. However, the question of whether the low diversity of the kākāpō fecal microbiota is an inadvertent consequence of human interventions has yet to be investigated. To that end, we used high-throughput Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons obtained from fecal material of 63 kākāpō representing different diets, islands, and ages. Remarkably, neither supplementary feeding nor geographic location were associated with significant differences in the overall fecal microbial community structures of adult kākāpō, suggesting that the kākāpō's low-diversity fecal microbiota is both inherent to this species and robust to these external influences.",Microbiome,Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

570,2017,Vaginal and Uterine Bacterial Communities in Postpartum Lactating Cows,"Reproductive inefficiency in cattle has major impacts on overall productivity of cattle operations, increasing cost of production, and impacting the sustainability of the cattle enterprise. Decreased reproductive success and associated disease states have been correlated with the presence of specific microbes and microbial community profiles, yet details of the relationship between microbial communities and host physiology are not well known. The present study profiles and compares the microbial communities in the bovine uterus and vagina using 16S rRNA sequencing of the V1–V3 hypervariable region at the time of artificial insemination. Significant differences (p < 0.05) between the vaginal and uterine communities were observed at the level of α-diversity metrics, including Chao1, Shannon’s Diversity Index, and observed OTU. Greater clustering of vaginal OTU was apparent in principal coordinate analysis compared to uterine OTU, despite greater diversity in the vaginal community in both weighted and unweighted UniFrac distance matrices (p < 0.05). There was a significantly greater relative abundance of unassigned taxa in the uterus (p = 0.008), otherwise there were few differences between the overall community profiles. Both vaginal and uterine communities were dominated by Firmicutes, although the relative abundance of rRNA sequences corresponding to species in this phylum was significantly (p = 0.007) lower in the uterine community. Additional differences were observed at the genus level, specifically in abundances within Clostridium (p = 0.009), Anaerofustis (p = 0.018), Atopobium (p = 0.035), Oscillospira (p = 0.035), 5-7N15 (p = 0.035), Mycoplasma (p = 0.035), Odoribacter (p = 0.042), and within the families Clostridiaceae (p = 0.006), Alcaligenaceae (p = 0.021), and Ruminococcaceae (p = 0.021). Overall, the comparison revealed differences and commonalities among bovine reproductive organs, which may be influenced by host physiology. The increased abundance of unassigned taxa found in the uterus may play a significant biological role in the reproductive status of the animal. The study represents an initial dataset for comparing bacterial communities prior to establishment of pregnancy.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
571,2017,"Cross-talk among metabolic parameters, esophageal microbiota, and host gene expression following chronic exposure to an obesogenic diet","Unhealthy diets, and ensuing weight gain, predispose individuals to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. We examined the effect of chronic high fat diet (HFD) on the esophageal microbiota of Sprague Dawley rats using Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing (V4, 515 F/806 R) and on esophageal expression of IL18, PTGS2, PPARA, FFAR3, and CRAT. The relationships among metabolic parameters, esophageal microbiota, and host gene expression were determined. We observed a significant difference between the upper and lower esophageal microbiota in control fed rats, emphasized by enrichment of Lactobacillus species in the lower esophagus. Rats on HFD gained significantly more fat and had reduced insulin sensitivity. Diet type significantly affected the esophageal microbiota, with Clostridium sensu stricto being enriched in both upper and lower segments of HFD fed rats. Of interest, bacterial pathways related to carotenoid biosynthesis were significantly decreased in the lower esophagus of HFD fed rats. We observed strong correlations between metabolic parameters, the esophageal microbial profiles, and host esophageal gene expression. In particular, Fusobacterium, Rothia, and Granulicatella showed consistent correlations across a range of metabolic and gene markers. Our data indicates that unhealthy diets can significantly alter the esophageal microbiota, and enrich for bacterial species previously associated with chronic gastrointestinal diseases.","Bacteria, Virus, Microbiome",,Metabarcoding,Health & Disease

573,2016,Computational workflow for the fine-grained analysis of metagenomic samples,"The field of metagenomics, defined as the direct genetic analysis of uncultured samples of genomes contained within an environmental sample, is gaining increasing popularity. The aim of studies of metagenomics is to determine the species present in an environmental community and identify changes in the abundance of species under different conditions. Current metagenomic analysis software faces bottlenecks due to the high computational load required to analyze complex samples. A computational open-source workflow has been developed for the detailed analysis of metagenomes. This workflow provides new tools and datafile specifications that facilitate the identification of differences in abundance of reads assigned to taxa (mapping), enables the detection of reads of low-abundance bacteria (producing evidence of their presence), provides new concepts for filtering spurious matches, etc. Innovative visualization ideas for improved display of metagenomic diversity are also proposed to better understand how reads are mapped to taxa. Illustrative examples are provided based on the study of two collections of metagenomes from faecal microbial communities of adult female monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs concordant for leanness or obesity and their mothers. The proposed workflow provides an open environment that offers the opportunity to perform the mapping process using different reference databases. Additionally, this workflow shows the specifications of the mapping process and datafile formats to facilitate the development of new plugins for further post-processing. This open and extensible platform has been designed with the aim of enabling in-depth analysis of metagenomic samples and better understanding of the underlying biological processes.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,"(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

575,2020,Integrating metatranscriptomes and metagenomes for deconvolution of composition and expression in human gut and artificial communities,"Over the last 15 years the human microbiome has received increasing attention.During this time, many studies have contributed to shed light on the complex network of interactions both between the microorganisms and their host, and within microbial communities themselves. 
While traditionally aiming at assessing composition, recent studies have broadened this scope to multi-dimensional aspects, using multi-omics approaches.By integrating information about genomes, transcripts, proteins and metabolites, a holistic understanding of the microbiome is now within reach.However progressive, these studies generally suffer from a lack of closure, as interpretation and integration of this data is all but straightforward. 
In the particular case of metatranscriptomes, species abundance and gene expression are coupled into a single readout.Consequently, normalization of this data is a crucial but poorly understood and unresolved problem. Here I present different approaches to normalise metatranscriptomes and highlight procedural concerns when obtaining this type of data. 
Results show that better normalization strategies are necessary when integrating multi-omics data and that controlled pilot experiments are required for a better understanding of the intricate dynamics and interactions between members of these communities. This work further exposes concerns about the interpretation of functional aspects of microbial populations, primarily driven by the many uncontrolled sources of variation herein discussed. 
As these new data types become more widespread, methods will certainly evolve towards better standardization and controlled procedures. This will help the microbiome field to move beyond its descriptive state into one able to provide a more detailed and mechanistic understanding.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics, (Meta)transcriptomics, Metatranscriptomics, Metabolomics",
576,2018,Cross-feeding interactions of gut symbionts driven by human milk oligosaccharidesand mucins,"The co-evolution of the human host and the gut microbiota has led to bacterial adaption to forage on host-produced glycans such as human milk oligosaccharides (HMOS) and mucins. In early life, the HMOS that are present in mother milk contribute to the establishment of a healthy gut microbiota. Furthermore, mucins that cover the intestinal lining create a stable niche for bacterial colonization throughout a person’s life. Due to the highly complex nature of these host-secreted glycans, bacteria equipped with specific glycan-degrading enzymes can exploit them as substrate for growth. Subsequently, the glycan-degrading bacteria can drive microbial networks via cross-feeding. The glycan-foraging microbial population exerts a large influence on the host physiology, by influencing the immune, metabolic, and neurological development early in life, and by conferring colonisation resistance throughout life. The work described in this thesis aims to improve our understanding of the metabolic dependencies between the milk- and mucin-degrading microbes (Akkermansia muciniphila, Bifidobacterium spp. and Bacteroides spp.) and butyrate-producing bacteria (Anaerostipes caccae, Eubacterium hallii, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii). Bacteria-derived butyrate is the preferred energy source for host epithelial cells and is associated with a range of beneficial effects including enhancement of colonic barrier function, increased satiety, and protection against inflammation, and cancer. In the introductory chapter, the role of human milk and mucin glycans in fostering the gut microbial network is discussed. As such, the molecular mechanisms of glycan-foraging by key microbial species and the potential butyrate-inducing interaction among gut symbionts is presented. In Chapter 2 and 3, the role of HMOS as selective substrates for microbial growth that drive the establishment of the infant gut microbiota was investigated. At this developmental stage, HMOS promote the dominance of bifidobacteria from the Actinobacteria phylum. Upon weaning, the gut microbiota shifts towards an adult gut microbiota composition that is predominantly comprised of bacteria from the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla. In chapter 2, the interaction between a HMOS-degrader, Bifidobacterium infantis (Actinobacteria phylum) and a butyrogenic non-HMOS-degrader, Anaerostipes caccae (a member of the Lachnospiraceae from the Firmicutes phylum) was studied. Anaerostipes caccae in monoculture was not able to metabolise lactose or HMOS but its growth and concomitant butyrate production were detected in co-cultures with Bifidobacterium infantis. Anaerostipes caccae was sustained by cross-feeding on the monosaccharides, lactate and acetate derived from Bifidobacterium infantis. Bifidobacterium infantis fully degraded lactose and the complete range of low molecular weight HMOS, pointing towards the key ecological role of bifidobacteria in providing substrates for other important emerging species in the infant gut. The gradual shift of the microbiota composition in the ecosystem contributing to the slow induction of butyrate could also be important for gut maturation. In chapter 3, the microbial network formation in the infant gut driven by another HMOS-degrading species, namely Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was studied. We showed that Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron could drive the butyrogenic trophic chain with Anaerostipes caccae. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron could metabolise lactose and HMOS. The bacterium showed different preference for specific HMOS structures when grown in co-culture. Subsequently, Anaerostipes caccae cross-fed on Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron-derived monosaccharides, lactate and acetate for growth and butyrate production. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron might drive the establishment of the microbial network in the infant gut, leading to the sequential establishment of adult-like functional groups such as lactate-utilising and butyrate-producing bacteria. Furthermore, we observed stereospecific lactate isomer production in which Bacteroides spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. produced predominantly D- and L-lactate, respectively. The distinct lactate isomer production by these major glycans-degrading genera might affect the gut microbiota compositions by differential cross-feeding interaction with the lactate-utilisers. Chapter 4 and 5 studied the role of mucins in creating a micro-environment that leads to the formation of a microbial network at the intestinal mucosal layer. In chapter 4, we demonstrated that Akkermansia muciniphila, a gut symbiont specialised in mucin degradation, could support the growth of the butyrate-producing cross-feeders Anaerostipes caccae, Eubacterium hallii, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Akkermansia muciniphila metabolised the complex mucin glycans into short chain fatty acids including acetate, propionate and 1,2-propanediol as well as the mucin-derived sugars. Subsequently, acetate and the liberated sugars could be used by the butyrate-producers for growth and concomitant butyrate production. Interestingly, a bidirectional cross-feeding was observed between Akkermansia muciniphila and Eubacterium hallii. Pseudo-vitamin B12 produced by Eubacterium hallii facilitated propionate production by Akkermansia muciniphila via the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway. Propionate could be beneficial to the human host by regulating satiety and lipid biosynthesis in the liver, indicative of a mutualistic host-microbial interaction driven by mucin glycans. In chapter 5, we studied the molecular mechanism of cross-feeding between Akkermansia muciniphila and Anaerostipes caccae by metatranscriptomics. We observed a differential transcriptional response of Akkermansia muciniphila grown in monoculture as compared to a co-culture together with Anaerostipes caccae. In particular, the expression of the extracellular mucin-degrading enzymes by Akkermansia muciniphila was heightened in co-cultures. As a result, the monosaccharides liberated from the breakdown of mucin oligosaccharides chain could support the central metabolism of both Akkermansia muciniphila and the butyrate-producer. This suggested that Akkermansia muciniphila plays a key role in supporting the microbial community at the mucosal environment of the intestine by increasing the availability of substrates. In summary, this thesis demonstrated the key functional role of milk- and mucin-degrading symbionts in fostering a butyrogenic microbial network via cross-feeding. Ecologically, HMOS-degraders are critical to drive the establishment of a healthy infant gut microbiota, whilst mucin-degraders are vital to maintain a beneficial mucosal community. A better understanding of the complex nature of both the microbial network and the host-secreted glycans could aid in the design of nutritional intervention for health improvement. To this end, innovative avenues using novel probiotic strains (key species including Akkermansia muciniphila, Bacteroides spp. and butyrate-producing Clostridium), prebiotics (HMOS in early nutrition) and microbiota-targeted nutrients (iron and vitamin B12) deem promising.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome, AMR","(Meta)transcriptomics, Metatranscriptomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

579,2023,Bacterial diversity and community characteristics of the sinus and dental regions in adults with odontogenic sinusitis,"Background The microbiome plays a crucial role in odontogenic sinusitis (OS); however, the bacterial characteristics of the sinuses and connected dental regions in OS are poorly understood. In this study, nasal secretion samples were collected from 41 OS patients and 20 simple nasal septum deviation patients, and oral mucosa samples from dental regions were collected from 28 OS patients and 22 impacted tooth extraction patients. DNA was extracted, and 16S rRNA sequencing was performed to explore the characteristics and structure of the microbiome in the sinuses and dental regions of OS patients. Results The alpha diversity of the oral and nasal microbiomes in OS patients was higher than that in controls. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) showed that oral samples clustered separately from nasal samples, and the beta diversity of oral and nasal samples in OS patients was higher than that in controls. The dominant phylum was Bacteroidetes in OS patients and Firmicutes in controls in both the oral and nasal cavity. The dominant genera in the oral microbiome and nasal microbiome of OS patients were similar, including Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas and Prevotella . Co-occurrence network analysis showed decreased microbial connectivity in the oral mucosa and nasal secretion samples of OS patients. Conclusions Odontogenic infection promotes structural and functional disorders of the nasal microbiome in OS. The interaction of dominant pathogens in the nasal and oral regions may promote the development of OS. Our study provides the microbiological aetiology of the nasal and connected dental regions in OS and is expected to provide novel insights into the diagnosis and therapeutic strategies for OS.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome",Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
580,2021,Microbiome Analysis Reveals Microecological Balance in the Emerging Rice–Crayfish Integrated Breeding Mode,"The interaction between the microbial communities in aquatic animals and those in the ambient environment is important for both healthy aquatic animals and the ecological balance of aquatic environment. Crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), with their high commercial value, have become the highest-yield freshwater shrimp in China. The traditional cultivation in ponds (i.e., monoculture, MC) and emerging cultivation in rice co-culture fields (i.e., rice–crayfish co-culture, RC) are the two main breeding modes for crayfish, and the integrated RC is considered to be a successful rice-livestock integration practice in eco-agricultural systems. This study explored the ecological interactions between the microbial communities in crayfish intestine and the ambient environment, which have not been fully described to date. The bacterial communities in crayfish intestine, the surrounding water, and sediment in the two main crayfish breeding modes were analyzed with MiSeq sequencing and genetic networks. In total, 53 phyla and 1,206 genera were identified, among which Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Tenericutes, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, RsaHF231, and Nitrospirae were the dominant phyla. The microbiota composition significantly differed between the water, sediment, and crayfish intestine, while it did not between the two breeding modes. We also generated a co-occurrence correlation network based on the high-confidence interactions with Spearman correlation ρ ≥ 0.75. In the genera co-correlation network, 95 nodes and 1,158 edges were identified, indicating significant genera interactions between crayfish intestine and the environment. Furthermore, the genera clustered into three modules, based on the different environments. Additionally, Candidatus_Bacilloplasma, g_norank_f_Steroidobacteraceae, Dinghuibacter, Hydrogenophaga, Methyloparacoccus, and Defluviicoccus had the highest betweenness centrality and might be important in the interaction between crayfish and the ambient environment. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of the characteristics of the microbiota in crayfish and their surrounding environment. Moreover, our findings provide insights into the microecological balance in crayfish eco-agricultural systems and theoretical reference for the development of such systems.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Interactome",,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
581,2021,Efficient chito‐oligosaccharide utilization requires two TonB‐dependent transporters and one hexosaminidase in Cellvibrio japonicus,"Chitin utilization by microbes plays a significant role in biosphere carbon and nitrogen cycling, and studying the microbial approaches used to degrade chitin will facilitate our understanding of bacterial strategies to degrade a broad range of recalcitrant polysaccharides. The early stages of chitin depolymerization by the bacterium Cellvibrio japonicus have been characterized and are dependent on one chitin‐specific lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase and nonredundant glycoside hydrolases from the family GH18 to generate chito‐oligosaccharides for entry into metabolism. Here, we describe the mechanisms for the latter stages of chitin utilization by C. japonicus with an emphasis on the fate of chito‐oligosaccharides. Our systems biology approach combined transcriptomics and bacterial genetics using ecologically relevant substrates to determine the essential mechanisms for chito‐oligosaccharide transport and catabolism in C. japonicus. Using RNAseq analysis we found a coordinated expression of genes that encode polysaccharide‐degrading enzymes. Mutational analysis determined that the hex20B gene product, predicted to encode a hexosaminidase, was required for efficient utilization of chito‐oligosaccharides. Furthermore, two gene loci (CJA_0353 and CJA_1157), which encode putative TonB‐dependent transporters, were also essential for chito‐oligosaccharides utilization. This study further develops our model of C. japonicus chitin metabolism and may be predictive for other environmentally or industrially important bacteria.",Bacteria,,(Meta)transcriptomics,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
582,2020,The gut microbiome affects the responses of heart valve replacement patients to the anticoagulant warfarin,"
 Backgrounds: Numerous algorithms based on patient genetic variants have been established with the aim of reducing the risk of GI bleeding and thromboembolism during warfarin administration. However, approximately 35% of individual warfarin sensitivity remains unexplained. Gut microbiota composition related to the vitamin K generation should be taken into account. Methods : Faecal samples were collected from 200 inpatients undergoing heart valve replacement (HVR). Ultimately, faecal samples from 80 inpatients (27 low responders (LRs), 27 high responders (HRs) and 26 normal responders (NRs) were analyzed for microbiota composition through 16S rDNA sequencing. Fifteen samples (5 LRs, 5 HRs and 5 NRs) were also analyzed through metagenomic whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing. We validated the results from 10 LRs, 10 HRs and 10 NRs. Results: Significant differences were observed in the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome among the three groups. The genera Bacteroides, Escherichia-Shigella and Klebsiella were enriched in the LRs, while the genus Enterococcus was enriched in the HRs. WGS sequencing indicated that the abundance of enzymes, modules and KO associated with bacterial vitamin K biosynthesis was significantly higher in LRs than in HRs or NRs. The 12 optimal microbial markers were identified through tenfold cross-validation with a random forest model. Conclusions: This study characterized gut microbiome in the different response to warfarin of HVR patients and suggested that gut microbiome might play an important role in the clinical warfarin anticoagulation therapy.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Variant","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
583,2019,Black soldier fly larvae (Hermetia illucens) strengthen the metabolic function of food waste biodegradation by gut microbiome,"Vermicomposting using black soldier fly (BSF) larvae (Hermetia illucens) has gradually become a promising biotechnology for waste management, but knowledge about the larvae gut microbiome is sparse. In this study, 16S rRNA sequencing, SourceTracker, and network analysis were leveraged to decipher the influence of larvae gut microbiome on food waste (FW) biodegradation. The microbial community structure of BSF vermicompost (BC) changed greatly after larvae inoculation, with a peak colonization traceable to gut bacteria of 66.0%. The relative abundance of 11 out of 21 metabolic function groups in BC were significantly higher than that in natural composting (NC), such as carbohydrate‐active enzymes. In addition, 36.5% of the functional genes in BC were significantly higher than those in NC. The changes of metabolic functions and functional genes were significantly correlated with the microbial succession. Moreover, the bacteria that proliferated in vermicompost, including Corynebacterium, Vagococcus, and Providencia, had strong metabolic abilities. Systematic and complex interactions between the BSF gut and BC bacteria occurred over time through invasion, altered the microbial community structure, and thus evolved into a new intermediate niche favourable for FW biodegradation. The study highlights BSF gut microbiome as an engine for FW bioconversion, which is conducive to bioproducts regeneration from wastes.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome",Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
584,2017,The microbiome in PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome,"Germline PTEN mutations defining PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) confer heritable predisposition to breast, endometrial, thyroid and other cancers with known age-related risks, but it remains impossible to predict if any individual will develop cancer. In the general population, gut microbial dysbiosis has been linked to cancer, yet is unclear whether these are associated in PHTS patients. In this pilot study, we aimed to characterize microbial composition of stool, urine, and oral wash from 32 PTEN mutation-positive individuals using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. PCoA revealed clustering of the fecal microbiome by cancer history (P = 0.03, R 2 = 0.04). Fecal samples from PHTS cancer patients had relatively more abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from family Rikenellaceae and unclassified members of Clostridia compared to those from non-cancer patients, whereas families Peptostreptococcaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Bifidobacteriaceae represented relatively more abundant OTUs among fecal samples from PHTS non-cancer patients. Functional metagenomic prediction revealed enrichment of the folate biosynthesis, genetic information processing and cell growth and death pathways among fecal samples from PHTS cancer patients compared to non-cancer patients. We found no major shifts in overall diversity and no clustering by cancer history among oral wash or urine samples. Our observations suggest the utility of an expanded study to interrogate gut dysbiosis as a potential cancer risk modifier in PHTS patients.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

586,2017,Factors influencing ruminal bacterial community diversity and composition and microbial fibrolytic enzyme abundance in lactating dairy cows with a focus on the role of active dry yeast.,"The objective of the current study was to employ a DNA-based sequencing technology to study the effect of active dry yeast (ADY) supplementation, diet type, and sample location within the rumen on rumen bacterial community diversity and composition, and to use an RNA-based method to study the effect of ADY supplementation on rumen microbial metabolism during high-grain feeding (HG). Our previous report demonstrated that the supplementation of lactating dairy cows with ADY attenuated the effect of subacute ruminal acidosis. Therefore, we used samples from that study, where 16 multiparous, rumen-cannulated lactating Holstein cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 dietary treatments: ADY (Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y1242, 80 billion cfu/animal per day) or control (carrier only). Cows received a high-forage diet (77:23, forage:concentrate), then were abruptly switched to HG (49:51, forage:concentrate). Rumen bacterial community diversity and structure were highly influenced by diet and sampling location (fluid, solids, epimural). The transition to HG reduced bacterial diversity, but epimural bacteria maintained a greater diversity than fluid and solids. Analysis of molecular variance indicated a significant separation due to diet × sampling location, but not due to treatment. Across all samples, the analysis yielded 6,254 nonsingleton operational taxonomic units (OTU), which were classified into several phyla: mainly Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Fibrobacteres, Tenericutes, and Proteobacteria. High forage and solids were dominated by OTU from Fibrobacter, whereas HG and fluid were dominated by OTU from Prevotella. Epimural samples, however, were dominated in part by Campylobacter. Active dry yeast had no effect on bacterial community diversity or structure. The phylum SR1 was more abundant in all ADY samples regardless of diet or sampling location. Furthermore, on HG, OTU2 and OTU3 (both classified into Fibrobacter succinogenes) were more abundant with ADY in fluid and solids than control samples. This increase with ADY was paralleled by a reduction in prominent Prevotella OTU. Metatranscriptomic profiling of rumen microbiome conducted on random samples from the HG phase showed that ADY increased the abundance of the cellulase endo-β-1,4-glucanase and had a tendency to increase the hemicellulase α-glucuronidase. In conclusion, the shift from high forage to HG and sampling location had a more significant influence on ruminal bacterial community abundance and structure compared with ADY. However, evidence suggested that ADY can increase the abundance of some dominant anaerobic OTU belonging to F. succinogenes and phylum SR1. Further, microbial mRNA-based evidence suggested that ADY can increase the abundance of a specific microbial fibrolytic enzymes.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,"(Meta)transcriptomics, Metatranscriptomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
587,2017,Organic nitrogen rearranges both structure and activity of the soil-borne microbial seedbank,"Use of organic amendments is a valuable strategy for crop production. However, it remains unclear how organic amendments shape both soil microbial community structure and activity, and how these changes impact nutrient mineralization rates. We evaluated the effect of various organic amendments, which range in Carbon/Nitrogen (C/N) ratio and degradability, on the soil microbiome in a mesocosm study at 32, 69 and 132 days. Soil samples were collected to determine community structure (assessed by 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequences), microbial biomass (fungi and bacteria), microbial activity (leucine incorporation and active hyphal length), and carbon and nitrogen mineralization rates. We considered the microbial soil DNA as the microbial seedbank. High C/N ratio favored fungal presence, while low C/N favored dominance of bacterial populations. Our results suggest that organic amendments shape the soil microbial community structure through a feedback mechanism by which microbial activity responds to changing organic inputs and rearranges composition of the microbial seedbank. We hypothesize that the microbial seedbank composition responds to changing organic inputs according to the resistance and resilience of individual species, while changes in microbial activity may result in increases or decreases in availability of various soil nutrients that affect plant nutrient uptake.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR",Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

There is substantial interest in breeding and managing crops that host root microbial communities that increase productivity. The eudicot model species Arabidopsis has been used to investigate these processes, however a model for monocotyledons is also required. We characterized the rhizosphere microbiome and root exudates of Brachypodium distachyon, to develop it as a rhizosphere model for cereal species like wheat. The Brachypodium rhizosphere microbial community was dominated by Burkholderiales. However, these communities were also dependent on how tightly they were bound to roots, the root type they were associated with (nodal or seminal roots), and their location along the roots. Moreover, the functional gene categories detected in microorganisms isolated from around root tips differed from those isolated from bases of roots. The Brachypodium rhizosphere microbiota and root exudate profiles were similar to those reported for wheat rhizospheres, and different to Arabidopsis. The differences in root system development and cell wall chemistry between monocotyledons and eudicots may also influence the microorganism composition of these major plant types.

590,2015,Selective Sweeps and Parallel Pathoadaptation Drive Pseudomonas aeruginosa Evolution in the Cystic Fibrosis Lung,"ABSTRACT Pulmonary infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa are a recalcitrant problem in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. While the clinical implications and long-term evolutionary patterns of these infections are well studied, we know little about the short-term population dynamics that enable this pathogen to persist despite aggressive antimicrobial therapy. Here, we describe a short-term population genomic analysis of 233 P. aeruginosa isolates collected from 12 sputum specimens obtained over a 1-year period from a single patient. Whole-genome sequencing and antimicrobial susceptibility profiling identified the expansion of two clonal lineages. The first lineage originated from the coalescence of the entire sample less than 3 years before the end of the study and gave rise to a high-diversity ancestral population. The second expansion occurred 2 years later and gave rise to a derived population with a strong signal of positive selection. These events show characteristics consistent with recurrent selective sweeps. While we cannot identify the specific mutations responsible for the origins of the clonal lineages, we find that the majority of mutations occur in loci previously associated with virulence and resistance. Additionally, approximately one-third of all mutations occur in loci that are mutated multiple times, highlighting the importance of parallel pathoadaptation. One such locus is the gene encoding penicillin-binding protein 3, which received three independent mutations. Our functional analysis of these alleles shows that they provide differential fitness benefits dependent on the antibiotic under selection. These data reveal that bacterial populations can undergo extensive and dramatic changes that are not revealed by lower-resolution analyses. IMPORTANCE Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a bacterial opportunistic pathogen responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Once it has colonized the lung in CF, it is highly resilient and rarely eradicated. This study presents a deep sampling examination of the fine-scale evolutionary dynamics of P. aeruginosa in the lungs of a chronically infected CF patient. We show that diversity of P. aeruginosa is driven by recurrent clonal emergence and expansion within this patient and identify potential adaptive variants associated with these events. This high-resolution sequencing strategy thus reveals important intraspecies dynamics that explain a clinically important phenomenon not evident at a lower-resolution analysis of community structure.

591,2014,Meta'omic analytic techniques for studying the intestinal microbiome.,"Nucleotide sequencing has become increasingly common and affordable, and is now a vital tool for studies of the human microbiome. Comprehensive microbial community surveys such as MetaHit and the Human Microbiome Project have described the composition and molecular functional profile of the healthy (normal) intestinal microbiome. This knowledge will increase our ability to analyze host and microbial DNA (genome) and RNA (transcriptome) sequences. Bioinformatic and statistical tools then can be used to identify dysbioses that might cause disease, and potential treatments. Analyses that identify perturbations in specific molecules can leverage thousands of culture-based isolate genomes to contextualize culture-independent sequences, or may integrate sequence data with whole-community functional assays such as metaproteomic or metabolomic analyses. We review the state of available systems-level models for studies of the intestinal microbiome, along with analytic techniques and tools that can be used to determine its functional capabilities in healthy and unhealthy individuals.",Microbiome,"Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis","(Meta)genomics, (Meta)transcriptomics, (Meta)proteomics, Metaproteomics, Metabolomics",Health & Disease

594,2012,Antibiotic resistance reservoirs : the cases of sponge and human gut microbiota,"One of the major threats to human health in the 21st century is the emergence of pathogenic bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics, thereby limiting treatment options. An important route through which pathogens become resistant is via acquisition of resistance genes from environmental and human-associated bacteria. Yet, it is poorly understood to what extent and by what mechanisms these so-called reservoirs contribute to emerging resistance. Therefore, the work described in this thesis focussed on generating novel insights into different niches as sources of resistance, with a particular focus on the human gut microbiota as well as on microbial communities associated with marine sponges, especially because the latter have been described as one of the richest sources of bioactive secondary metabolites, including a broad range of antimicrobials. Cultivation-based methods were complemented with culture-independent approaches in order to study bacterial taxa that are not readily cultivated. Using metatranscriptomics it was found that clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes are expressed in a broad range of environmental niches including human, mouse and pig gut microbiota, sea bacterioplankton, a marine sponge, forest soil and sub-seafloor sediment. The diversity of resistance gene transcripts differed greatly per niche indicating that the environment contains a rich reservoir of functional resistance that could be accessible by pathogens. Even though resistance gene expression might be linked to the presence of natural antibiotics, we did not detect expression of the corresponding secondary metabolite biosynthesis clusters. Thirty-one antibiotic-resistant bacteria, amongst which three belonging to potentially novel Flavobacteriaceae spp., were isolated from the Mediterranean sponges Aplysina aerophoba, Corticium candelabrum and Petrosia ficiformis. Isolates were identified in a high throughput manner by double-barcoded 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Furthermore, analysis of sponge tissue-derived bacterial biomass growing on agar media showed that many novel bacterial taxa can still be isolated by conventional cultivation methods. Genomic DNA from the 31 antibiotic resistant bacteria was interrogated with respect to the presence of active resistance genes by functional metagenomics. In addition, we also screened metagenomic libraries prepared from DNA directly isolated from sponge tissue in order to circumvent the need for cultivation. In total, 37 unique resistance genes were identified, and the predicted gene products of 15 of these shared <90% amino acid identity with known gene products. One resistance gene (blaPSV-1), which was classified into a new β-lactamase family, was found to be exclusive to the marine specific genus Pseudovibrio. These findings raised questions as to the functional roles of these genes in sponges, but more importantly, the functionality of these genes in E. coli shows that they can potentially be harnessed by phylogenetically distinct bacteria in other environments, including human pathogens. As such, it is a wake-up call as to the significance of marine resistance reservoirs. Pseudovibrio, a genus of α-Proteobacteria, was studied in more detail by comparative genomics as it comprises bacteria that potentially play a role as sponge symbionts and marine hubs of antibiotics resistance. Based on gene content, members of the genus Pseudovibrio were found to cluster by sponge sampling location indicating geographic speciation. Furthermore, Pseudovibrio spp. isolated from sponges near the Spanish coast clustered by sponge, suggesting host-specific colonization or adaptation. Strong support for Pseudovibrio spp. forming symbiotic relations with sponges came from the presence of a plethora of (predicted) conserved symbiosis-related functions in their genomes. A final study aimed to isolate novel antibiotic resistant reservoir species from the human gut microbiota using a targeted approach. Faecal samples from hospitalized patients that received Selective Digestive Decontamination (SDD), a prophylactic treatment with a cocktail of different antibiotics (tobramycin, polymyxin E, amphotericin B and cefotaxime), were inoculated anaerobically on agar media, after which bacterial biomass was analysed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Six novel taxa were identified that, based on their growth on media supplemented with the SDD antibiotics, could serve as clinically relevant reservoirs of antibiotic resistance. For one of these six taxa a member was obtained in pure culture by targeted isolation. The abundance of antibiotic resistant uncultivated taxa in the human gut microbiota warrants further research as to their potential roles in resistance dissemination. In conclusion, this thesis provides deeper insights into different environmental niches as reservoirs of antibiotic resistance. The results can serve to prime and inspire future research.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, AMR, Comparative analysis","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics, (Meta)transcriptomics, Metatranscriptomics, Metabolomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
595,2010,MTR: taxonomic annotation of short metagenomic reads using clustering at multiple taxonomic ranks,"Motivation: Metagenomics is a recent field of biology that studies microbial communities by analyzing their genomic content directly sequenced from the environment. A metagenomic dataset consists of many short DNA or RNA fragments called reads. One interesting problem in metagenomic data analysis is the discovery of the taxonomic composition of a given dataset. A simple method for this task, called the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA), is employed in state-of-the-art computational tools for metagenomic data analysis of very short reads (about 100 bp). However LCA has two main drawbacks: it possibly assigns many reads to high taxonomic ranks and it discards a high number of reads. Results: We present MTR, a new method for tackling these drawbacks using clustering at Multiple Taxonomic Ranks. Unlike LCA, which processes the reads one-by-one, MTR exploits information shared by reads. Specifically, MTR consists of two main phases. First, for each taxonomic rank, a collection of potential clusters of reads is generated, and each potential cluster is associated to a taxon at that rank. Next, a small number of clusters is selected at each rank using a combinatorial optimization algorithm. The effectiveness of the resulting method is tested on a large number of simulated and real-life metagenomes. Results of experiments show that MTR improves on LCA by discarding a significantly smaller number of reads and by assigning much more reads at lower taxonomic ranks. Moreover, MTR provides a more faithful taxonomic characterization of the metagenome population distribution.

596,2025,"Soil microbial diversity, functionality, and community structure are differently affected by diverse types of biochar","Using organic wastes for biochar production represents an innovative approach to waste management, facilitating safe residue disposal while producing a soil amendment by‐product. The characteristics of biochar strongly depend on the chemical composition of the feedstock utilised in its production. Consequently, even within the same agroecosystem, different types of biochar may produce varying effects on soil chemistry and biology. In a greenhouse experiment, we assessed the impact of poultry manure and peanut shell biochars on soil chemical properties and their effects on microbial community structure, abundance, diversity and functions analysed through biochemical and molecular approaches. Thus, a two‐factor experimental design was established, considering biochar type (poultry manure and peanut shell biochars) and rate (0%, 1%, and 3% w/w). Our findings highlighted that the intrinsic properties of biochar significantly influenced its ability to induce changes in the analysed variables. Poultry manure biochar exhibited greater efficacy in increasing soil pH and EC, simultaneously enhancing fungal and total biomasses. Meanwhile, peanut shell biochar increased N content and decreased C/N, slightly impacting fungal and total biomasses. The effects of biochars on FAMEs and chemical variables were dose‐dependent; the higher the application rate, the greater the observed effect. Interestingly, different biochar types affected distinct bacterial taxa abundances. Among the dominant Phyla, while poultry manure biochar increased the relative abundance of Chloroflexi and decreased that of Proteobacteria, peanut shell biochar increased Acidobacteria and reduced Firmicutes phyla. The biochar rate did not affect bacterial abundance. Notably, only peanut shell biochar increased bacterial richness. Poultry manure biochar positively impacted functions related to metabolism, whereas the effect of peanut shell biochar was less evident. Our study revealed that the intrinsic characteristics of biochar significantly modulate the structure and functionality of the soil microbial community. Therefore, understanding the inherent characteristics of biochar is crucial to promoting the development of specific groups of soil microorganisms, thus optimising the cycling of essential nutrients.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis",,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

599,2024,Effect of Pharmaceutically Active Antibiotics on Gut Metagenome of Mother and Infant,"
 
 
 Metagenomics plays a vital role in studying microbial genomes and their implications for human health. The human gut microbiome begins to develop at birth and is shaped by factors such as maternal nutrition and antibiotic exposure. Disruptions in this microbial community can impact an infant’s immune system, metabolism, and susceptibility to various diseases. This research aims to predict the taxonomic and functional profiling of the gut metagenome in mothers and infants exposed to antibiotics. The study utilized gut metagenomic samples retrieved from the European nucleotide archive database under accession number PRJNA698986. Four samples were analyzed, including two maternal gut metagenome samples and two corresponding infant samples. The design focuses on a comprehensive assessment of microbial diversity and functional pathways using advanced bioinformatics for detailed taxonomic classification and functional analysis of the metagenomic data.
 
 
 
 Taxonomic analysis was conducted using MetaPhlAn2 to extract and analyze community structure. Functional analysis was performed with HUMAnN2 to evaluate community functions.
 
 
 
 Metagenomic analysis revealed significant differences in microbial communities between infants and their mothers. The infants’ initial gut microbiome exhibited a diverse presence of both bacteria and viruses, whereas maternal samples predominantly contained bacteria, with a minor representation of archaea.
 
 
 
 This study highlights the impact of antibiotic exposure on the gut metagenome of infants, illustrating distinct differences in microbial community composition compared to mothers. The findings emphasize the need for further research to understand the functional roles of these microbial communities in health and disease.

601,2024,Analyses of Xenorhabdus griffiniae genomes reveal two distinct sub-species that display intra-species variation due to prophages,"Nematodes of the genus Steinernema and their Xenorhabdus bacterial symbionts are lethal entomopathogens that are useful in the biocontrol of insect pests, as sources of diverse natural products, and as research models for mutualism and parasitism. Xenorhabdus play a central role in all aspects of the Steinernema lifecycle, and a deeper understanding of their genomes therefore has the potential to spur advances in each of these applications. Here, we report a comparative genomics analysis of Xenorhabdus griffiniae, including the symbiont of Steinernema hermaphroditum nematodes, for which genetic and genomic tools are being developed. We sequenced and assembled circularized genomes for three Xenorhabdus strains: HGB2511, ID10 and TH1. We then determined their relationships to other Xenorhabdus and delineated their species via phylogenomic analyses, concluding that HGB2511 and ID10 are Xenorhabdus griffiniae while TH1 is a novel species. These additions to the existing X. griffiniae landscape further allowed for the identification of two subspecies within the clade. Consistent with other Xenorhabdus, the analysed X. griffiniae genomes each encode a wide array of antimicrobials and virulence-related proteins. Comparative genomic analyses, including the creation of a pangenome, revealed that a large amount of the intraspecies variation in X. griffiniae is contained within the mobilome and attributable to prophage loci. In addition, CRISPR arrays, secondary metabolite potential and toxin genes all varied among strains within the X. griffiniae species. Our findings suggest that phage-related genes drive the genomic diversity in closely related Xenorhabdus symbionts, and that these may underlie some of the traits most associated with the lifestyle and survival of entomopathogenic nematodes and their bacteria: virulence and competition. This study establishes a broad knowledge base for further exploration of not only the relationships between X. griffiniae species and their nematode hosts but also the molecular mechanisms that underlie their entomopathogenic lifestyle.","Bacteria, Virus, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR, Comparative analysis","(Meta)genomics, Metabolomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
602,2024,Effects of diet on the bacterial and eukaryotic microbiota across the gastrointestinal tract of healthy rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus).,"OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to characterize the bacterial and eukaryotic microbiota of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in domestic rabbits and to evaluate the effect of different diet characteristics, such as pelleting, extrusion, and hay supplementation.


ANIMALS
30 New Zealand White rabbits (15 male and 15 female; 6 to 7 months old) were fed 1 of 6 diets (5 rabbits per diet) for 30 days after an initial acclimation period. At the end of the trial, samples were collected from the stomach, small intestine, cecum, large intestine, and hard feces.


METHODS
The samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer 1 region-targeted amplicon sequencing.


RESULTS
The bacterial microbiota was distinct between the foregut and hindgut. The most abundant bacterial genera included an unclassified genus in the Bacteroidales order and Alistipes. Candida was the most abundant genus in the eukaryotic dataset. In the bacterial dataset, diet No Hay/Pellet E was shown to have lower diversity (Shannon diversity, P < .05) compared to all diet groups except for No Hay/Pellet M. Few significant differences in alpha-diversity indexes between diet groups were detected in the eukaryotic dataset.


CLINICAL RELEVANCE
Our findings demonstrated that feeding hay had a significant effect on the beta diversity of the bacterial microbiota. Given the prevalence of gastrointestinal disease in the domestic rabbit population, furthering our understanding of what constitutes a healthy rabbit microbiota and the effects of different diets on the microbial community can help veterinarians implement better intervention strategies and allow pet owners to provide the best level of care.","Bacteria, Eukaryote, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
603,2024,"Human saliva modifies growth, biofilm architecture, and competitive behaviors of oral streptococci","ABSTRACT The bacteria within supragingival biofilms participate in complex exchanges with other microbes inhabiting the same niche. One example is the mutans group streptococci (Streptococcus mutans), implicated in the development of tooth decay, and other health-associated commensal streptococci species. Previously, our group transcriptomically characterized intermicrobial interactions between S. mutans and several species of oral bacteria. However, these experiments were carried out in a medium without human saliva. To better mimic their natural environment, we first evaluated how inclusion of saliva affected growth and biofilm formation of eight Streptococcus species individually and found saliva to positively benefit growth rates while negatively influencing biofilm biomass accumulation and altering spatial arrangement. These results carried over during evaluation of 29 saliva-derived isolates of various species. Surprisingly, we also found that addition of saliva increased the competitive behaviors of S. mutans in coculture competitions against commensal streptococci that led to increases in biofilm microcolony volumes. Through transcriptomically characterizing mono- and cocultures of S. mutans and Streptococcus oralis with and without saliva, we determined that each species developed a nutritional niche under mixed-species growth, with S. mutans upregulating carbohydrate uptake and utilization pathways while S. oralis upregulated genome features related to peptide uptake and glycan foraging. S. mutans also upregulated genes involved in oxidative stress tolerance, particularly manganese uptake, which we could artificially manipulate by supplementing in manganese leading to an advantage over its opponent. Our report highlights observable changes in microbial behaviors through leveraging environmental- and host-supplied resources over their competitors. IMPORTANCE Dental caries (tooth decay) is the most prevalent disease for both children and adults nationwide. Caries are initiated from demineralization of the enamel due to organic acid production through the metabolic activity of oral bacteria growing in biofilm communities attached to the tooth’s surface. Mutans group streptococci are closely associated with caries development and initiation of the cariogenic cycle, which decreases the amount of acid-sensitive, health-associated commensal bacteria while selecting for aciduric and acidogenic species that then further drives the disease process. Defining the exchanges that occur between mutans group streptococci and oral commensals in a condition that closely mimics their natural environment is of critical need toward identifying factors that can influence odontopathogen establishment, persistence, and outgrowth. The goal of our research is to develop strategies, potentially through manipulation of microbial interactions characterized here, that prevent the emergence of mutans group streptococci while keeping the protective flora intact.

604,2023,Metabarcoding for plant pathologists,"Abstract Metabarcoding is a method that uses high-throughput sequencing to characterize microbial communities. This approach involves PCR-based amplification of a single locus from environmental DNA of communities of organisms, sequencing the resulting amplicons, and comparing those sequences to reference databases to infer the taxonomic identities of organisms present. By comparing the identity and number of associated sequences between samples, the data produced by metabarcoding can be used to reveal differences among sample types and identify biological variables that correlate with differences. However, metabarcoding is affected by a myriad of technical factors including sampling technique, DNA extraction methods, as well as choice of primers, locus for PCR amplification, and data analysis procedures. The resulting outputs will be both complex and semi-quantitative. The methods used can affect reliability of results including false positives and negatives, especially if the goal is to confidently survey the presence of plant pathogens. This article reviews the status of metabarcoding as it pertains to plant pathology and provides guidance on experimental design and analyses of bacterial, fungal, and oomycete datasets.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
605,2023,The genome of a steinernematid-associated Pseudomonas piscis bacterium encodes the biosynthesis of insect toxins,"Several species of soil-dwelling Steinernema nematodes are used in the biocontrol of crop pests, due to their natural capacity to kill diverse lepidopteran species. Although this insect-killing trait is known to be augmented by the nematodes’ Xenorhabdus endosymbionts, the role of other steinernematid-associated bacterial genera in the nematode lifecycle remains unclear. This genomic study aimed to determine the potential of Pseudomonas piscis to contribute to the entomopathogenicity of its Steinernema host. Insect larvae were infected with three separate Steinernema cultures. From each of the three treatments, the prevalent bacteria in the haemocoel of cadavers, four days post-infection, were isolated. These three bacterial isolates were morphologically characterised. DNA was extracted from each of the three bacterial isolates and used for long-read genome sequencing and assembly. Assemblies were used to delineate species and identify genes that encode insect toxins, antimicrobials, and confer antibiotic resistance. We assembled three complete genomes. Through digital DNA–DNA hybridisation analyses, we ascertained that the haemocoels of insect cadavers previously infected with Steinernema sp. Kalro, Steinernema sp. 75, and Steinernema sp. 97 were dominated by Xenorhabdus griffiniae Kalro, Pseudomonas piscis 75, and X. griffiniae 97, respectively. X. griffiniae Kalro and X. griffiniae 97 formed a subspecies with other X. griffiniae symbionts of steinernematids from Kenya. P. piscis 75 phylogenetically clustered with pseudomonads that are characterised by high insecticidal activity. The P. piscis 75 genome encoded the production pathway of insect toxins such as orfamides and rhizoxins, antifungals such as pyrrolnitrin and pyoluteorin, and the broad-spectrum antimicrobial 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol. The P. piscis 75 genome encoded resistance to over ten classes of antibiotics, including cationic lipopeptides. Steinernematid-associated P. piscis bacteria hence have the biosynthetic potential to contribute to nematode entomopathogenicity.","Bacteria, Pathogen","Isolate, AMR, MAGs",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

607,2023,Feeding an unsalable carrot total-mixed ration altered bacterial amino acid degradation in the rumen of lambs,"The objective of this study was to determine the influence of a total-mixed ration including unsalable carrots at 45% DM on the rumen microbiome; and the plasma, rumen and liver metabolomes. Carrots discarded at processing were investigated as an energy-dense substitute for barley grain in a conventional feedlot diet, and improved feed conversion efficiency by 25%. Here, rumen fluid was collected from 34 Merino lambs at slaughter (n = 16 control; n = 18 carrot) after a feeding period of 11-weeks. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced to profile archaeal and bacterial microbe communities. Further, a comprehensive, targeted profile of known metabolites was constructed for blood plasma, rumen fluid and biopsied liver metabolites using a gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS) metabolomics approach. An in vitro batch culture was used to characterise ruminal fermentation including gas and methane (CH_4) production. In vivo rumen microbial community structure of carrot fed lambs was dissimilar ( P  < 0.01; PERMANOVA), and all measures of alpha diversity were greater ( P  < 0.01), compared to those fed the control diet. Unclassified genera in Bacteroidales (15.9 ± 6.74% relative abundance; RA) were more abundant ( P  < 0.01) in the rumen fluid of carrot-fed lambs, while unclassified taxa in the Succinivibrionaceae family (11.1 ± 3.85% RA) were greater ( P  < 0.01) in the control. The carrot diet improved in vitro ruminal fermentation evidenced as an 8% increase ( P  < 0.01) in DM digestibility and a 13.8% reduction ( P  = 0.01) in CH_4 on a mg/ g DM basis, while the control diet increased ( P  = 0.04) percentage of propionate within total VFA by 20%. Fourteen rumen fluid metabolites and 27 liver metabolites were influenced ( P  ≤ 0.05) by diet, while no effect ( P  ≥ 0.05) was observed in plasma metabolites. The carrot diet enriched (impact value = 0.13; P  = 0.01) the tyrosine metabolism pathway (acetoacetic acid, dopamine and pyruvate), while the control diet enriched (impact value = 0.42; P  ≤ 0.02) starch and sucrose metabolism (trehalose and glucose) in rumen fluid. This study demonstrated that feeding 45% DM unsalable carrots diversified bacterial communities in the rumen. These dietary changes influenced pathways of tyrosine degradation, such that previous improvements in feed conversion efficiency in lambs could be explained.","Bacteria, Archaea, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,"Metabarcoding, (Meta)proteomics, Metabolomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
608,2023,A hydrogenotrophic Sulfurimonas is globally abundant in deep-sea oxygen-saturated hydrothermal plumes,"An uncultivated, aerobic chemolithotrophic Sulfurimonas species with a reduced genome is abundant across diverse, hydrogen-rich hydrothermal plumes in the deep ocean. Members of the bacterial genus Sulfurimonas (phylum Campylobacterota) dominate microbial communities in marine redoxclines and are important for sulfur and nitrogen cycling. Here we used metagenomics and metabolic analyses to characterize a Sulfurimonas from the Gakkel Ridge in the Central Arctic Ocean and Southwest Indian Ridge, showing that this species is ubiquitous in non-buoyant hydrothermal plumes at Mid Ocean Ridges across the global ocean. One Sulfurimonas species, ^U Sulfurimonas pluma , was found to be globally abundant and active in cold (<0−4 °C), oxygen-saturated and hydrogen-rich hydrothermal plumes. Compared with other Sulfurimonas species, ^U S. pluma has a reduced genome (>17%) and genomic signatures of an aerobic chemolithotrophic metabolism using hydrogen as an energy source, including acquisition of A2-type oxidase and loss of nitrate and nitrite reductases. The dominance and unique niche of ^U S. pluma in hydrothermal plumes suggest an unappreciated biogeochemical role for Sulfurimonas in the deep ocean.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,"(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
609,2023,Diversity of the Antimicrobial Peptide Genes in Collembola,"Simple Summary Collembola (springtails) are tiny non-insect hexapods living in soil and have an important ecological role as detritivores. How they can survive in the microbe-rich environment for millions of years is unclear. This study used homology-based gene identification methods to identify antimicrobial peptide genes from collembola genomes and transcriptomes. We analyzed five collembola species representing three main suborders and identified 45 antimicrobial peptide genes from five families: diapausin, Alo, diptericin, defensin, and cecropin. These peptides potentially have broad activity against bacteria, fungi, and viruses. This study highlights collembola as a new source for discovering novel AMPs that may help solve the current multidrug-resistant pathogen crisis. Abstract Multidrug-resistant bacteria are a current health crisis threatening the world’s population, and scientists are looking for new drugs to combat them. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which are part of the organism’s innate immune system, are a promising new drug class as they can disrupt bacterial cell membranes. This study explored antimicrobial peptide genes in collembola, a non-insect hexapod lineage that has survived in microbe-rich habitats for millions of years, and their antimicrobial peptides have not been thoroughly investigated. We used in silico analysis (homology-based gene identification, physicochemical and antimicrobial property prediction) to identify AMP genes from the genomes and transcriptomes of five collembola representing three main suborders: Entomobryomorpha (Orchesella cincta, Sinella curviseta), Poduromorpha (Holacanthella duospinosa, Anurida maritima), and Symphypleona (Sminthurus viridis). We identified 45 genes belonging to five AMP families, including (a) cysteine-rich peptides: diapausin, defensin, and Alo; (b) linear α-helical peptide without cysteine: cecropin; (c) glycine-rich peptide: diptericin. Frequent gene gains and losses were observed in their evolution. Based on the functions of their orthologs in insects, these AMPs potentially have broad activity against bacteria, fungi, and viruses. This study provides candidate collembolan AMPs for further functional analysis that could lead to medicinal use.","Bacteria, Virus, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, AMR, Gene identification / Biomarker","(Meta)genomics, (Meta)transcriptomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
610,2023,New Insights on Endophytic Microbacterium-Assisted Blast Disease Suppression and Growth Promotion in Rice: Revelation by Polyphasic Functional Characterization and Transcriptomics,"Plant growth-promoting endophytic microbes have drawn the attention of researchers owing to their ability to confer fitness benefits in many plant species. Here, we report agriculturally beneficial traits of rice-leaf-adapted endophytic Microbacterium testaceum. Our polyphasic taxonomic investigations revealed its identity as M. testaceum. The bacterium displayed typical endophytism in rice leaves, indicated by the green fluorescence of GFP-tagged M. testaceum in confocal laser scanning microscopy. Furthermore, the bacterium showed mineral solubilization and production of IAA, ammonia, and hydrolytic enzymes. Tobacco leaf infiltration assay confirmed its non-pathogenic nature on plants. The bacterium showed antifungal activity on Magnaporthe oryzae, as exemplified by secreted and volatile organic metabolome-mediated mycelial growth inhibition. GC-MS analysis of the volatilome of M. testaceum indicated the abundance of antimicrobial compounds. Bacterization of rice seedlings showed phenotypic traits of MAMP-triggered immunity (MTI), over-expression of OsNPR1 and OsCERK, and the consequent blast suppressive activity. Strikingly, M. testaceum induced the transcriptional tradeoff between physiological growth and host defense pathways as indicated by up- and downregulated DEGs. Coupled with its plant probiotic features and the defense elicitation activity, the present study paves the way for developing Microbacterium testaceum-mediated bioformulation for sustainably managing rice blast disease.","Bacteria, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, AMR, SNP","(Meta)transcriptomics, Metabolomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

The primary objective of this study was to develop and test a selective and differential plating medium for the isolation of E. albertii from enteric pathogens commonly transmitted via fresh poultry meat, namely E. coli and Salmonella enterica. MacConkey agar supplemented with α-D-+-melibiose and the lactose analogue X-gal was prepared and used to differentially enumerate E. albertii, Salmonella, and E. coli from inoculated ground chicken meat. The medium, MXgMac agar, differentiated the inoculated pathogens with a greater degree of efficiency than did the previously developed E. albertii-selective medium xylose–rhamnose–melibiose (XRM) MacConkey agar, based on differential usage of the lactose analogue and melibiose. Chicken-derived feces and litter samples were subsequently tested using the medium and found not to contain E. albertii by 16S rRNA gene amplification. MXgMac agar facilitates improved differential recovery of E. albertii and other enteric pathogens from poultry meat versus other E. albertii selective/differential media.","Bacteria, Pathogen",AMR,Metabarcoding,Health & Disease
612,2022,Silent gene clusters encode magnetic organelle biosynthesis in a non-magnetotactic phototrophic bacterium,"Horizontal gene transfer is a powerful source of innovations in prokaryotes that can affect almost any cellular system, including microbial organelles. The formation of magnetosomes, one of the most sophisticated microbial mineral-containing organelles synthesized by magnetotactic bacteria for magnetic navigation in the environment, was also shown to be a horizontally transferrable trait. However, the mechanisms determining the fate of such genes in new hosts are not well understood, since non-adaptive gene acquisitions are typically rapidly lost and become unavailable for observation. This likely explains why gene clusters encoding magnetosome biosynthesis have never been observed in non-magnetotactic bacteria. Here, we report the first discovery of a horizontally inherited dormant gene clusters encoding biosynthesis of magnetosomes in a non-magnetotactic phototrophic bacterium Rhodovastum atsumiense . We show that these clusters were inactivated through transcriptional silencing and antisense RNA regulation, but retain functionality, as several genes were able to complement the orthologous deletions in a remotely related magnetotactic bacterium. The laboratory transfer of foreign magnetosome genes to R. atsumiense was found to endow the strain with magnetosome biosynthesis, but strong negative selection led to rapid loss of this trait upon subcultivation, highlighting the trait instability in this organism. Our results provide insight into the horizontal dissemination of gene clusters encoding complex prokaryotic organelles and illuminate the potential mechanisms of their genomic preservation in a dormant state.",Bacteria,Functional analysis,(Meta)genomics,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
613,2022,Ensiled Mixed Vegetables Enriched Carbohydrate Metabolism in Heterofermentative Lactic Acid Bacteria,"This study evaluated the fermentation quality, nutritive profile, in vitro fermentation, and microbial communities colonising sorghum ensiled with an unsalable vegetable mixture (chopped beans, carrot, and onion (1:1:1) ) including: (1)−100% sorghum; (2)−80% sorghum + 20% vegetable mix or (3)−60% sorghum + 40% vegetable mix, on a dry matter (DM) basis, with or without a probiotic inoculant. Samples were obtained across 0, 1, 3, 5,7, and 101 days ensiling and after 14 d aerobic exposure. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene and the ITS1 region were sequenced to profile bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities. Compared to the 0% DM, ethanol increased (p < 0.01) from 8.42 to 20.4 ± 1.32 mM with 40% DM vegetable mix inclusion, while lactate decreased from 5.93 to 2.24 ± 0.26 mM. Linear discriminant analysis revealed that relative abundances of 12 bacterial taxa were influenced by silage treatments (log LDA score ≥ 4.02; p ≤ 0.03), while predicted functional pathways of alternative carbohydrate metabolism (hexitol, sulfoquinovose and glycerol degradation; N-acetyl glucosamine biosynthesis; log LDA score ≥ 2.04; p ≤ 0.02) were similarly enriched. This study indicated that carbohydrate metabolism by heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria can increase the feed value of sorghum when ensiled with an unsalable vegetable mixture at 40%DM, without requiring a high quantity of lactate.","Bacteria, Archaea, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis",Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
614,2022,A Practical Bioinformatics Workflow for Routine Analysis of Bacterial WGS Data,"The use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for bacterial characterisation has increased substantially in the last decade. Its high throughput and decreasing cost have led to significant changes in outbreak investigations and surveillance of a wide variety of microbial pathogens. Despite the innumerable advantages of WGS, several drawbacks concerning data analysis and management, as well as a general lack of standardisation, hinder its integration in routine use. In this work, a bioinformatics workflow for (Illumina) WGS data is presented for bacterial characterisation including genome annotation, species identification, serotype prediction, antimicrobial resistance prediction, virulence-related genes and plasmid replicon detection, core-genome-based or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based phylogenetic clustering and sequence typing. Workflow was tested using a collection of 22 in-house sequences of Salmonella enterica isolates belonging to a local outbreak, coupled with a collection of 182 Salmonella genomes publicly available. No errors were reported during the execution period, and all genomes were analysed. The bioinformatics workflow can be tailored to other pathogens of interest and is freely available for academic and non-profit use as an uploadable file to the Galaxy platform.","Bacteria, Pathogen","Isolate, AMR, SNP, Annotation",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease
615,2022,A short exposure to a semi-natural habitat alleviates the honey bee hive microbial imbalance caused by agricultural stress,"Honeybee health and the species’ gut microbiota are interconnected. Also noteworthy are the multiple niches present within hives, each with distinct microbiotas and all coexisting, which we termed “apibiome”. External stressors (e.g. anthropization) can compromise microbial balance and bee resilience. We hypothesised that (1) the bacterial communities of hives located in areas with different degrees of anthropization differ in composition, and (2) due to interactions between the multiple microbiomes within the apibiome, changes in the community of a niche would impact the bacteria present in other hive sections. We characterised the bacterial consortia of different niches (bee gut, bee bread, hive entrance and internal hive air) of 43 hives from 3 different environments (agricultural, semi-natural and natural) through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Agricultural samples presented lower community evenness, depletion of beneficial bacteria, and increased recruitment of stress related pathways (predicted via PICRUSt2). The taxonomic and functional composition of gut and hive entrance followed an environmental gradient. Arsenophonus emerged as a possible indicator of anthropization, gradually decreasing in abundance from agriculture to the natural environment in multiple niches. Importantly, after 16 days of exposure to a semi-natural landscape hives showed intermediate profiles, suggesting alleviation of microbial dysbiosis through reduction of anthropization.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis, Interactome",Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
616,2022,Application of MinION sequencing as a tool for the rapid detection and characterization of Listeria monocytogenes in smoked salmon,"Microbial pathogens may be present in different types of foods, and hence the development of novel methods to assure consumers' safeness is of great interest. Molecular methods are known to provide sensitive and rapid results; however, they are typically targeted approaches. In recent years, the advent of non-targeted approaches based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) has emerged as a rational way to proceed. This technology allows for the detection of several pathogens simultaneously. Furthermore, with the same set of data, it is possible to characterize the microorganisms in terms of serotype, virulence, and/ or resistance genes, among other molecular features. In the current study, a novel method for the detection of Listeria monocytogenes based on the “quasimetagenomics” approach was developed. Different enrichment media and immunomagnetic separation (IMS) strategies were compared to determine the best approach in terms of L. monocytogenes sequences generated from smoked salmon samples. Finally, the data generated were analyzed with a user-friendly workflow that simultaneously provided the species identification, serotype, and antimicrobial resistance genes. The new method was thoroughly evaluated against a culture-based approach, using smoked salmon inoculated with L. monocytogenes as the matrix of choice. The sequencing method reached a very low limit of detection (LOD50, 1.2 CFU/ 25 g) along with high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity (100%), and a perfect correlation with the culture-based method (Cohen's k = 1.00). Overall, the proposed method overcomes all the major limitations reported for the implementation of NGS as a routine food testing technology and paves the way for future developments taking its advantage into consideration.",Pathogen,AMR,"(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Health & Disease
617,2022,Condition-Specific Mapping of Operons (COSMO) using dynamic and static genome data,"An operon is a set of adjacent genes which are transcribed into a single messenger RNA. Operons allow prokaryotes to efficiently circumvent environmental stresses. It is estimated that about 60% of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome is arranged into operons, which makes them interesting drug targets in the face of emerging drug resistance. We therefore developed COSMO - a tool for operon prediction in M. tuberculosis using RNA-seq data. We analyzed four algorithmic parameters and benchmarked COSMO against two top performing operon predictors. COSMO outperformed both predictors in its accuracy and in its ability to distinguish operons activated under distinct conditions. Author Summary Operons may be important drug targets for the development of effective anti-microbials to combat the emerging, global drug resistance challenge. However, there is a shortage of known Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) operons. This is exacerbated by the fact that current operon predictors are not optimized for the unique genome of Mtb. COSMO removes the limitations imposed by using the constraints of a specific organism’s genome and exploits RNA-seq data instead. This allows COSMO to more accurately predict full-length operons in Mtb, and it also avails COSMO to other microorganisms for the same purpose.",Bacteria,AMR,(Meta)genomics,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
618,2022,An ultra-sensitive method to detect mutations in human RAS templates,"ABSTRACT The RAS family of small GTPases is mutated in roughly a fifth of human cancers. Hotspot point mutations at codons G12, G13, and Q61 account for 95% of all these mutations, which are well established to render the encoded proteins oncogenic. In humans, this family comprises three genes: HRAS, NRAS, and KRAS. Accumulating evidence argues that oncogenic RAS point mutations may be initiating, as they are often truncal in human tumours and capable of inducing tumorigenesis in mice. As such, there is great interest in detecting oncogenic mutation in the RAS genes to understand the origins of cancer, as well as for early detection purposes. To this end, we previously adapted the microbial ultra-sensitive M aximum D epth S equencing (MDS) assay for the murine Kras gene, which was capable of detecting oncogenic mutations in the tissues of mice days after carcinogen exposure, essentially capturing the very first step in tumour initiation. Given this, we report here the adaption and details of this assay to detect mutations in a human KRAS sequence at an analytic sensitivity of one mutation in a million independently barcoded templates. This humanized version of MDS can thus be exploited to detect oncogenic mutations in KRAS at an incredible sensitivity and modified for the same purpose for the other RAS genes.",,,,Health & Disease
619,2022,Unsalable Vegetables Ensiled With Sorghum Promote Heterofermentative Lactic Acid Bacteria and Improve in vitro Rumen Fermentation,"This study characterized the nutritive and microbial profiles and the fermentation characteristics of silage with the following compositions on a dry matter (DM) basis: (1) 100% sorghum, (2) 70% sorghum + 30% carrot or pumpkin, and (3) 40% sorghum + 60% carrot or pumpkin. The treatments were further divided based on the addition or no addition of a probiotic inoculant. After 70 days of ensiling, the silage was incubated for 48 h using the in vitro batch culture technique. Crude protein and non-fiber carbohydrates in the silage increased (P ≤ 0.01) by 5.7 percent point (pp) and 9.6 pp, respectively, with pumpkin at 60% DM. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced to profile pre-ensiled and ensiled archeal and bacterial communities. Silages containing carrot or pumpkin strongly influenced the microbial structure (PERMANOVA: R2 = 0.75; P < 0.001), despite the ensiled treatments being dominated by Lactobacillus spp., except for the control, which was dominated by Weissella and Pediococcus spp. (P < 0.01). Linear discriminant analysis indicated that carrot and pumpkin silages were responsible for the increased relative abundance of Lactobacillus and Acinetobacter spp. (log LDA score ≥ 2), respectively. After 48 h of incubation, carrot and pumpkin inclusion increased (P < 0.01) the in vitro DM digestibility by 22.5 and 31.3%, increased the total volatile fatty acids (VFAs) by 16 and 20.6% (P < 0.01), respectively, and showed a tendency (P = 0.07) to increase the gas production. Therefore, this study supports the use of carrot or pumpkin in sorghum silages to maximize feed digestibility and total VFA concentrations.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
620,2022,Iron-Induced Respiration Promotes Antibiotic Resistance in Actinomycete Bacteria,"A widely investigated mode of antibiotic resistance occurs via mutations and/or by horizontal acquisition of resistance genes. In addition to this acquired resistance, most bacteria exhibit intrinsic resistance as an inducible and adaptive response to different classes of antibiotics. ABSTRACT The bacterial response to antibiotics eliciting resistance is one of the key challenges in global health. Despite many attempts to understand intrinsic antibiotic resistance, many of the underlying mechanisms still remain elusive. In this study, we found that iron supplementation promoted antibiotic resistance in Streptomyces coelicolor. Iron-promoted resistance occurred specifically against bactericidal antibiotics, irrespective of the primary target of antibiotics. Transcriptome profiling revealed that some genes in the central metabolism and respiration were upregulated under iron-replete conditions. Iron supported the growth of S. coelicolor even under anaerobic conditions. In the presence of potassium cyanide, which reduces aerobic respiration of cells, iron still promoted respiration and antibiotic resistance. This suggests the involvement of a KCN-insensitive type of respiration in the iron effect. This phenomenon was also observed in another actinobacterium, Mycobacterium smegmatis. Taken together, these findings provide insight into a bacterial resistance strategy that mitigates the activity of bactericidal antibiotics whose efficacy accompanies oxidative damage by switching the respiration mode. IMPORTANCE A widely investigated mode of antibiotic resistance occurs via mutations and/or by horizontal acquisition of resistance genes. In addition to this acquired resistance, most bacteria exhibit intrinsic resistance as an inducible and adaptive response to different classes of antibiotics. Increasing attention has been paid recently to intrinsic resistance mechanisms because this may provide novel therapeutic targets that help rejuvenate the efficacy of the current antibiotic regimen. In this study, we demonstrate that iron promotes the intrinsic resistance of aerobic actinomycetes Streptomyces coelicolor and Mycobacterium smegmatis against bactericidal antibiotics. A surprising role of iron to increase respiration, especially in a mode of using less oxygen, appears a fitting strategy to cope with bactericidal antibiotics known to kill bacteria through oxidative damage. This provides new insights into developing antimicrobial treatments based on the availability of iron and oxygen.",Bacteria,AMR,(Meta)transcriptomics,Health & Disease
621,2021,The influence of maternal unhealthy diet on maturation of offspring gut microbiota in rat,"Background Despite well-known effects of diet on gut microbiota diversity, relatively little is known about how maternal diet quality shapes the longitudinal maturation of gut microbiota in offspring. To investigate, we fed female rats standard chow (Chow) or a western-style, high-choice cafeteria diet (Caf) prior to and during mating, gestation and lactation. At weaning (3 weeks), male and female offspring were either maintained on their mother’s diet (ChowChow, CafCaf groups) or switched to the other diet (ChowCaf, CafChow). Fecal microbial composition was assessed in dams and longitudinally in offspring at 3, 7 and 14 weeks of age. Results The effect of maternal diet on maturation of offspring gut microbiota was assessed by α- and β-diversities, Deseq2/LEfSe, and SourceTracker analyses. Weanling gut microbiota composition was characterised by reduced α- and β-diversity profiles that clustered away from dams and older siblings. After weaning, offspring gut microbiota came to resemble an adult-like gut microbiota, with increased α-diversity and reduced dissimilarity of β-diversity. Similarly, Deseq2/LEfSe analyses found fewer numbers of altered operational taxonomic units (OTUs) between groups from weaning to adulthood. SourceTracker analyses indicated a greater overall contribution of Caf mothers’ microbial community (up to 20%) to that of their offspring than the contribution of Chow mothers (up to 8%). Groups maintained on the maternal diet (ChowChow, CafCaf), versus those switched to the other diet (ChowCaf, CafChow) post-weaning significantly differed from each other at 14 weeks (Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance), indicating interactive effects of maternal and post-weaning diet on offspring gut microbiota maturation. Nevertheless, this developmental trajectory was unaffected by sex and appeared consistent between ChowChow, CafCaf, ChowCaf and CafChow groups. Conclusions Introducing solid food at weaning triggered the maturation of offspring gut microbiota to an adult-like profile in rats, in line with previous human studies. Postweaning Caf diet exposure had the largest impact on offspring gut microbiota, but this was modulated by maternal diet history. An unhealthy maternal Caf diet did not alter the developmental trajectory of offspring gut microbiota towards an adult-like profile, insofar as it did not prevent the age-associated increase in α-diversity and reduction in β-diversity dissimilarity.",Microbiome,Community (taxonomy) profiling,,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
622,2021,Vertical community patterns of Labyrinthulomycetes protists reveal their potential importance in the oceanic biological pump.,"The biological pump plays a vital role in exporting organic particles into the deep ocean for long-term carbon sequestration. However, much remains unknown about some of its key microbial players. In this study, Labyrinthulomycetes protists (LP) were used to understand the significance of heterotrophic microeukaryotes in the transport of particulate organic matter from the surface to the dark ocean. Unlike the sharp vertical decrease of prokaryotic biomass, the LP biomass only slightly decreased with depth and eventually exceeded prokaryotic biomass in the bathypelagic layer. Sequencing identified high diversity of the LP communities with a dominance of Aplanochytrium at all depths. Notably, ASVs that were observed in the surface layer comprised ~20% of ASVs and ~ 60% of sequences in each of the deeper (including bathypelagic) layers, suggesting potential vertical export of the LP populations to the deep ocean. Further analyses of the vertical patterns of the 50 most abundant ASVs revealed niche partitioning of LP phylotypes in the pelagic ocean, including those could decompose organic detritus and/or facilitate the formation of fast-sinking particles. Overall, this study presents several lines of evidence that the LP can be an important component of the biological pump through their multiple ecotypes in the pelagic ocean.

624,2020,Long-Term Consumption of Anthocyanin-Rich Fruit Juice: Impact on Gut Microbiota and Antioxidant Markers in Lymphocytes of Healthy Males,"Polyphenols are considered protective against diseases associated with oxidative stress. Short-term intake of an anthocyanin-rich fruit juice resulted in significantly reduced deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) strand-breaks in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and affected antioxidant markers in healthy volunteers. Consequently, effects of long-term consumption of fruit juice are of particular interest. In focus was the impact on nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NFE2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2), the Nrf2-regulated genes NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) as well as effects on the gut microbiota. In a nine-week placebo-controlled intervention trial with 57 healthy male volunteers, consumption of anthocyanin-rich juice significantly increased NQO-1 and HO-1 transcript levels in PBLs compared to a placebo beverage as measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Three Nrf2-promotor single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), analyzed by pyrosequencing, indicated an association between individual Nrf2 transcript levels and genotype. Moreover, the Nrf2 genotype appeared to correlate with the presence of specific microbial organisms identified by 16S-PCR and classified as Spirochaetaceae. Furthermore, the microbial community was significantly affected by the duration of juice consumption and intake of juice itself. Taken together, long-term consumption of anthocyanin-rich fruit juice affected Nrf2-dependent transcription in PBLs, indicating systemic effects. Individual Nrf2 genotypes may influence the antioxidant response, thus requiring consideration in future intervention studies focusing on the Nrf2 pathway. Anthocyanin-rich fruit juice had an extensive impact on the gut microbiota.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, SNP",Metabarcoding,Health & Disease
625,2020,The Use of Bioinformatic Tools in Symbiosis and Co-Evolution Studies,"Through millions of years, the multicellular organisms have coexisted and coevolved with the surrounding microorganisms, in an almost symbiotic relationship forming a complex entity known as holobiont. The composition and functions of these microbial communities were limited during many years to only a mere fraction, due to the use of culture-based techniques. The advent of molecular-based techniques allowed the identification of uncultured organisms in a culture-free manner. In recent years, the development of next generation sequencing techniques have allowed the high-throughput study of microbial communities allowing the identification and classification of otherwise uncultured microorganisms in a given environment, tissue or host through metagenomics. The next generation sequencing techniques have been used in the functional study of microbial assemblages and were able to identify the role of the microorganisms in biogeochemical cycles, pathogenic processes, metabolism and development, through metatranscriptomics. Taken together, the next generation sequencing based-studies have shown the existence of a complex metabolic network in different hosts and environments, with the microbial communities. This chapter will focus in different available bioinformatic tools that are suitable to study symbiosis and coevolution processes in a given sample.","Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics, (Meta)transcriptomics, Metatranscriptomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
626,2025,"Microbial diversity of coastal microbial mats formations in karstic habitats from the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico","In this study, we report for the first time an exploration of the physicochemical characteristics and the prokaryotic diversity of three different types of microbial mats from karstic habitats located in Sisal, Progreso and Ría Lagartos, in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Our results showed that lift-off mats were found in the lower salinity (2.2%) area (Sisal), while flat and pustular mats were detected in hypersaline (6–9%) sites (Progreso and Ría Lagartos). Notably, some of these microbial mat structures were in close proximity to mangrove forest ecosystems with both degraded and restored regimes. XRD analysis revealed different mineral compositions of the mats; however, aragonite, calcite, and halite were commonly found in all samples studied. High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene identified differences in microbial communities across the different mat types, and statistical analyses revealed that salinity, redox potential, and temperature were significant factors in explaining the variance of the prokaryotic assemblages. Microbial groups identified in this study include those known to be important in the biogeochemical cycling of key elements, such as carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur. Interestingly, the community composition of flat and pustular mats from Progreso was similar, with Bacteroidia, Anaerolineae, and Phycisphaerae being the most abundant microbial groups in flat mats; and Bacteroidia, Anaerolineae, and Alphaproteobacteria dominating pustular mats. By contrast, flat mats from Ría Lagartos were dominated by Halobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Bacteroidota, while Bacteroidia, Gammaproteobacteria and Cyanobacteria dominated lift-off mats from Sisal. This work contributes to understanding the distribution, physicochemical characteristics and microbial diversity of coastal microbial mats, providing valuable new insights into microbial mats that develop in karstic ecosystems. This information is relevant to ongoing and future efforts to manage and preserve coastal ecosystems in the Yucatan Peninsula.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
627,2025,"Virulence genes and phylogenetic analysis of antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli isolated from pig slaughterhouses in Banten Province, Indonesia","Background and Aim: Escherichia coli is a prominent zoonotic pathogen with diverse virulence factors and significant antibiotic resistance, particularly in pig farming environments. Pig slaughterhouses are critical points of potential bacterial transmission to humans and the environment. Comprehensive genomic surveillance of E. coli in these settings remains limited in Indonesia. This study aimed to investigate the phylogenetic distribution, virulence gene profiles, pathotypes, and antibiotic resistance characteristics of E. coli isolated from pig slaughterhouses in Banten Province, Indonesia, using whole-genome sequencing. Materials and Methods: Environmental samples, including effluent and floor swabs (n = 200), were collected from 10 pig slaughterhouses. E. coli isolates were identified and previously characterized for antibiotic resistance. Genomic DNA was extracted and sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore MinION platform. Bioinformatic analyses, including virulence gene detection (VirulenceFinder), phylogenetic reconstruction (RAxML), and phylogroup determination (Clermont method), were conducted to classify isolates based on pathotype and genetic lineage. Results: Fifty-seven virulence genes were identified, including 46 associated with enteric pathotypes (Enterohemorrhagic E. coli: 35%, enterotoxigenic E. coli: 15%, and enteropathogenic E. coli: 5%) and 15 linked to extraintestinal pathotypes (uropathogenic E. coli: 95%, and neonatal meningitis E. coli: 5%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed five phylogroups - A, B1, D, G, and clade I - with A and B1 predominating. Most isolates (60%) exhibited a single pathotype, while a minority (5%) carried genes from multiple pathotypes. Serotypes O73, O78, and O157 were identified, with O73 being the most prevalent. No strong correlation was observed between phylogenetic clustering and virulence gene pathotype. Conclusion: The high prevalence of multidrug-resistant E. coli with diverse virulence genes in pig slaughterhouses highlights significant zoonotic and environmental health risks. These findings underscore the need for enhanced hygiene practices, antimicrobial stewardship, and longitudinal genomic surveillance in Indonesian pig production systems.","Bacteria, Pathogen","Isolate, AMR",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

The present study aimed to explore the linezolid resistance mechanisms and genomic characteristics of two vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis isolates from Bulgaria. The strains designated Efs2503-bg (inpatient from Pleven) and Efs966-bg (outpatient from Varna) were recovered from wounds in 2018 and 2023, respectively. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, whole-genome sequencing, multilocus sequence typing, and phylogenomic analysis based on 332 linezolid-resistant E. faecalis genomes were performed. Efs2503-bg was high-level resistant to linezolid (MIC > 256 mg/L) and displayed the G2576T mutation affecting three of the four 23S rDNA loci. Efs966-bg (MIC = 8 mg/L) carried a plasmid-located optrA determinant surrounded by fexA and ermA. No mutations in the genes encoding for ribosomal proteins L3, L4, and L22 were detected. The isolates belonged to the sequence types ST6 (Efs2503-bg) and ST1102 (Efs966-bg). Phylogenomic analysis revealed that Efs2503-bg and Efs966-bg are genetically distinct, with a difference of 12,051 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. To our knowledge, this is the first report of linezolid-resistant enterococci in Bulgaria.

631,2024,Genomic characterization of an uncommon Delftia acidovorans isolate obtained from a Bulgarian immunocompetent outpatient diagnosed with bronchitis.,"Delftia acidovorans is an aerobic, non-fermenting Gram-negative bacterium (NFGNB), found in soil, water and hospital environments. It is rarely clinically significant, most commonly affecting hospitalized or immunocompromised patients. The present study aimed to explore the genomic characteristics of a Bulgarian clinical D. acidovorans isolate (designated Dac759) in comparison to all strains of this species with available genomes in the NCBI Genome database (n = 34). Dac759 was obtained in 2021 from the sputum of a 65-year-old female immunocompetent outpatient with bronchitis. Species identification using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and phylogenomic analysis were performed. The isolate demonstrated high-level resistance to colistin (16 mg L-1); resistance to gentamicin; reduced susceptibility to piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin; and susceptibility to imipenem, meropenem, amikacin, and tobramycin. The observed genome size (6.43 Mb) and GC content (66.76%) were comparable with the accessible data from sequenced D. acidovorans genomes. A limited number of resistance determinants were identified in the assembled genome as follows: blaOXA-459, emrE, oqxB, and mexCD-oprJ. The phylogenomic analysis indicated a high heterogenicity of the included D. acidovorans genomes. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented case of a clinically relevant D. acidovorans isolate in Bulgaria. Unlike the majority of reports in the literature, Dac759 affected a patient with no malignancies or other preexisting comorbidities. With this in mind, its genome sequence is a valuable resource for the fundamental study of uncommon bacterial pathogens of public health importance.","Bacteria, Pathogen","Isolate, AMR","(Meta)genomics, (Meta)proteomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

634,2024,From soil to sequence: filling the critical gap in genome-resolved metagenomics is essential to the future of soil microbial ecology,"Soil microbiomes are heterogeneous, complex microbial communities. Metagenomic analysis is generating vast amounts of data, creating immense challenges in sequence assembly and analysis. Although advances in technology have resulted in the ability to easily collect large amounts of sequence data, soil samples containing thousands of unique taxa are often poorly characterized. These challenges reduce the usefulness of genome-resolved metagenomic (GRM) analysis seen in other fields of microbiology, such as the creation of high quality metagenomic assembled genomes and the adoption of genome scale modeling approaches. The absence of these resources restricts the scale of future research, limiting hypothesis generation and the predictive modeling of microbial communities.

635,2024,Gene Expression Analysis before and after the Pelvic Flexure in the Epithelium of the Equine Hindgut,"Simple Summary The equine hindgut plays a central role in digesting forage by hosting a complex community of microorganisms responsible for fermenting and digesting plant fibers. Research has shown that the different compartments of the hindgut have unique microbial communities. The pelvic flexure, an anatomic structure that separates segments of the hindgut and prevents backflow, seems to help maintain these distinct communities. How it achieves this has yet to be fully understood. While much is known about the hindgut’s anatomy and digestion, only a few studies have investigated gene expression patterns and differences in the tissues around the pelvic flexure. In this study, we used next-generation RNA sequencing to analyze and compare gene expression in the pelvic flexure and the ventral and dorsal segments of the large colon in horses. This knowledge can help researchers, veterinarians, and horse owners better understand the equine hindgut’s physiology and how horses interact with the microbial communities there and could provide insights for managing healthy horses or treating horses with digestive issues. Abstract Previous research demonstrated the distribution of distinct microbial communities in the equine hindgut surrounding the pelvic flexure. The current study evaluated gene expression in epithelial tissues surrounding the pelvic flexure to characterize patterns that might correlate with microbial distribution. Gene expression was determined by analyzing RNA sequence data from the pelvic flexure, the left and right ventral colon, and the left and right dorsal colon. An average of 18,330 genes were expressed across the five tissues sampled. Most of the genes showed some level of expression in all five tissues. Tissue-restricted patterns of expression were also observed. Genes with restricted expression in the left ventral and left dorsal colons have communication, signaling, and regulatory functions that correlate with their known physiology. In contrast, genes expressed exclusively in the pelvic flexure have diverse functions. The ontology of genes differentially expressed between the pelvic flexure and the surrounding tissues was associated with immune functions and signaling processes. Despite being non-significant, these enrichment trends were reinforced by the functions of statistically significant expression differences between tissues of the hindgut. These results provide insight into the physiology of the equine hindgut epithelium that might influence the microbiota and its distribution.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis",,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
636,2024,"Development of tools for the genetic manipulation of Campylobacter and their application to the N-glycosylation system of Campylobacter hepaticus, an emerging pathogen of poultry","ABSTRACT Various species of campylobacters cause significant disease problems in both humans and animals. The continuing development of tools and methods for genetic and molecular manipulation of campylobacters enables the detailed study of bacterial virulence and disease pathogenesis. Campylobacter hepaticus is an emerging pathogen that causes spotty liver disease (SLD) in poultry. SLD has a significant economic and animal welfare impact as the disease results in elevated mortalities and significant decreases in egg production. Although potential virulence genes of C. hepaticus have been identified, they have not been further studied and characterized, as appropriate genetic tools and methods to transform and perform mutagenesis studies in C. hepaticus have not been available. In this study, the genetic manipulation of C. hepaticus is reported, with the development of novel plasmid vectors, methods for transformation, site-specific mutagenesis, and mutant complementation. These tools were used to delete the pglB gene, an oligosaccharyltransferase, a central enzyme of the N-glycosylation pathway, by allelic exchange. In the mutant strain, N-glycosylation was completely abolished. The tools and methods developed in this study represent innovative approaches that can be applied to further explore important virulence factors of C. hepaticus and other closely related Campylobacter species. IMPORTANCE Spotty liver disease (SLD) of layer chickens, caused by infection with Campylobacter hepaticus, is a significant economic and animal welfare burden on an important food production industry. Currently, SLD is controlled using antibiotics; however, alternative intervention methods are needed due to increased concerns associated with environmental contamination with antibiotics, and the development of antimicrobial resistance in many bacterial pathogens of humans and animals. This study has developed methods that have enabled the genetic manipulation of C. hepaticus. To validate the methods, the pglB gene was inactivated by allelic exchange to produce a C. hepaticus strain that could no longer N-glycosylate proteins. Subsequently, the mutation was complemented by reintroduction of the gene in trans, on a plasmid vector, to demonstrate that the phenotypic changes noted were caused by the mutation of the targeted gene. The tools developed enable ongoing studies to understand other virulence mechanisms of this important emerging pathogen.

637,2024,"Influence of dietary mulberry (Morus alba L.) leaf supplementation on production performance, blood metabolites, rumen fermentation characteristics and ruminal bacteria community in lactating dairy cows","Abstract The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of mulberry (Morus alba L.) leaf (ML) supplementation on the productivity, blood metabolism, rumen fermentation characteristics and rumen microbial population in lactating dairy cows. Twelve healthy multiparous Holstein dairy cows (initial characteristics: body weight = 442.83 ± 86.87 kg; milk yield = 12.55 ± 1.91 kg/d; days in milk = 150.0 ± 47.0 d) were randomly allocated to two treatment groups of six cows each. The cows were fed two different diets: a control diet (basal diet without ML; CTRL group) and a ML-supplemented diet (basal diet + 300 g ML; ML group). The trial lasted for a total of 28 d after an adjustment period of 14 d. The total rumen volatile fatty acid (VFA) levels (p = .063) and the propionate level (p < .05) were increased in the ML group, whereas the ratio of acetate to propionate was significantly decreased (p < .05). A microbiome study demonstrated that the dietary treatments significantly influenced the composition of rumen bacteria. The ruminal populations of Paludibacter propionicigenes, Ruminococcus sp. JE7A12 and Prevotella oris were greater (p < .05) in ML group than in CTRL group, while Enterococcus faecalis numbers significantly decreased (p < .05) in the ML group. Supplementing a dairy cow diet with 300 g ML has the potential to alter the microbial community and fermentation in the rumen, leading to an increase in propionate synthesis. Highlights Feeding cows a mulberry leaf supplement increased total VFA and propionate concentrations in the rumen. Mulberry leaf supplementation increased the abundance of fibrolytic bacteria (Ruminococcus spp.) in the rumen. Mulberry leaf supplementation increased the rumen population of propionate-producing bacteria species (Paludibacter propionicigenes).","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabolomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
638,2024,Phage-Mediated Digestive Decolonization in a Gut-On-A-Chip Model: A Tale of Gut-Specific Bacterial Prosperity,"Infections due to antimicrobial-resistant bacteria have become a major threat to global health. Some patients may carry resistant bacteria in their gut microbiota. Specific risk factors may trigger the conversion of these carriages into infections in hospitalized patients. Preventively eradicating these carriages has been postulated as a promising preventive intervention. However, previous attempts at such eradication using oral antibiotics or probiotics have led to discouraging results. Phage therapy, the therapeutic use of bacteriophage viruses, might represent a worthy alternative in this context. Taking inspiration from this clinical challenge, we built Gut-On-A-Chip (GOAC) models, which are tridimensional cell culture models mimicking a simplified gut section. These were used to better understand bacterial dynamics under phage pressure using two relevant species: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Model mucus secretion was documented by ELISA assays. Bacterial dynamics assays were performed in GOAC triplicates monitored for 72 h under numerous conditions, such as pre-, per-, or post-bacterial timing of phage introduction, punctual versus continuous phage administration, and phage expression of mucus-binding properties. The potential genomic basis of bacterial phage resistance acquired in the model was investigated by variant sequencing. The bacterial “escape growth” rates under phage pressure were compared to static in vitro conditions. Our results suggest that there is specific bacterial prosperity in this model compared to other in vitro conditions. In E. coli assays, the introduction of a phage harboring unique mucus-binding properties could not shift this balance of power, contradicting previous findings in an in vivo mouse model and highlighting the key differences between these models. Genomic modifications were correlated with bacterial phage resistance acquisition in some but not all instances, suggesting that alternate ways are needed to evade phage predation, which warrants further investigation.","Bacteria, Virus, Microbiome","AMR, Variant",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease

However, a large knowledge gap exists in how T. alkaliphila functions. In this comparative genomic analysis, adaptations indicative of habitat specificity among strains and genomic similarity to known opportunistic pathogens are revealed. Genomic investigation reveals a core metabolic utilization of multiple oxidative and non-oxidative catabolic pathways, suggesting adaptability to varied environments and carbon sources. The genomic repertoire of T. alkaliphila includes secondary metabolites, such as antimicrobials and siderophores, indicative of its involvement in microbial competition and resource acquisition. Additionally, the presence of transposases, prophages, plasmids, and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-Cas systems in T. alkaliphila genomes suggests mechanisms for horizontal gene transfer and defense against viral predation. This comprehensive genomic analysis expands our understanding on the ecological functions, community interactions, and potential virulence of T. alkaliphila, while emphasizing its adaptability and diverse capabilities across environmental and host-associated ecosystems. IMPORTANCE As the microbial world continues to be explored, new organisms will emerge with beneficial and/or pathogenetic impact. Thiopseudomonas alkaliphila is a species originally isolated from clinical human tissue and fluid samples but has not been attributed to disease. Since its classification, T. alkaliphila has been found in animal guts, animal waste, decomposing remains, and biogas fermentation reactors. This is the first study to provide an in-depth view of the metabolic potential of publicly available genomes belonging to this species through a comparative genomics and draft pangenome calculation approach. It was found that T. alkaliphila is metabolically versatile and likely adapts to diverse energy sources and environments, which may make it useful for bioremediation and in industrial settings. A range of virulence factors and antibiotic resistances were also detected, suggesting T. alkaliphila may operate as an undescribed opportunistic pathogen.

Seven of the CRPA isolates investigated (Minimum inhibitory concentration values of imipenem and meropenem >32 mg L-1) were also resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, ceftazidime-avibactam, cefepime, ceftolozane-tazobactam, amikacin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin, but were susceptible to colistin (0.5-2 mg L-1) and cefiderocol (0.25-1 mg L-1). The P. aeruginosa Pae57 isolate (designated Pae57) remained susceptible to aminoglycosides as well. WGS uncovered the co-existence of blaNDM-1 and blaGES-1. The isolates belonged to the ST654 high-risk clone, except for Pae57 (ST611). Alignment against reference sequences revealed the presence of a Tn21 transposon harboring bleMBL-blaNDM-1-ISAba125. It was similar to that found in the P. aeruginosa ST654 NDM1_1 strain (GCA_020404785.1) from Serbia. Phylogenomic analysis of our isolates indicated that seven of them (ST654) differed from each other in no more than 44 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Pae57 (ST611) was strikingly different (>21,700 SNPs) compared to all Balkan strains. In conclusion, to our knowledge this is the first report of blaNDM-1-positive P. aeruginosa ST611 isolation, which indicates the transmission dynamics of this determinant between high-risk and potentially high-risk P. aeruginosa clones. Obtained results unveil the dissemination of clonally related NDM-1-producing P. aeruginosa strains in the monitored hospital for approximately a 2-year period.",,"Isolate, AMR, SNP",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease
641,2024,A novel clinical metaproteomics workflow enables bioinformatic analysis of host-microbe dynamics in disease,"ABSTRACT Clinical metaproteomics has the potential to offer insights into the host-microbiome interactions underlying diseases. However, the field faces challenges in characterizing microbial proteins found in clinical samples, usually present at low abundance relative to the host proteins. As a solution, we have developed an integrated workflow coupling mass spectrometry-based analysis with customized bioinformatic identification, quantification, and prioritization of microbial proteins, enabling targeted assay development to investigate host-microbe dynamics in disease. The bioinformatics tools are implemented in the Galaxy ecosystem, offering the development and dissemination of complex bioinformatic workflows. The modular workflow integrates MetaNovo (to generate a reduced protein database), SearchGUI/PeptideShaker and MaxQuant [to generate peptide-spectral matches (PSMs) and quantification], PepQuery2 (to verify the quality of PSMs), Unipept (for taxonomic and functional annotation), and MSstatsTMT (for statistical analysis). We have utilized this workflow in diverse clinical samples, from the characterization of nasopharyngeal swab samples to bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Here, we demonstrate its effectiveness via analysis of residual fluid from cervical swabs. The complete workflow, including training data and documentation, is available via the Galaxy Training Network, empowering non-expert researchers to utilize these powerful tools in their clinical studies. IMPORTANCE Clinical metaproteomics has immense potential to offer functional insights into the microbiome and its contributions to human disease. However, there are numerous challenges in the metaproteomic analysis of clinical samples, including handling of very large protein sequence databases for sensitive and accurate peptide and protein identification from mass spectrometry data, as well as taxonomic and functional annotation of quantified peptides and proteins to enable interpretation of results. To address these challenges, we have developed a novel clinical metaproteomics workflow that provides customized bioinformatic identification, verification, quantification, and taxonomic and functional annotation. This bioinformatic workflow is implemented in the Galaxy ecosystem and has been used to characterize diverse clinical sample types, such as nasopharyngeal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.

642,2024,Evaluation of Antimicrobial Resistancein Clinical Isolates of Enterococcus spp. Obtained from Hospital Patients in Latvia,"Background and Objective: Enterococci are typically found in a healthy human gastrointestinal tract but can cause severe infections in immunocompromised patients. Such infections are treated with antibiotics. This study addresses the rising concern of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Enterococci, focusing on the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) strains. Materials and Methods: The pilot study involved 140 Enterococci isolates collected between 2021 and 2022 from two multidisciplinary hospitals (with and without local therapeutic drug monitoring protocol of vancomycin) in Latvia. Microbiological assays and whole genome sequencing were used. AMR gene prevalence with resistance profiles were determined and the genetic relationship and outbreak evaluation were made by applying core genome multi-locus sequence typing (cgMLST). Results: The acquired genes and mutations were responsible for resistance against 10 antimicrobial classes, including 25.0% of isolates expressing resistance to vancomycin, predominantly of the vanB type. Genetic diversity among E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates was observed and seven potential outbreak clusters were identified, three of them containing sequence types ST6, ST78 and ST80. The prevalence of vancomycin resistance was highest in the hospital without a therapeutic drug-monitoring protocol and in E. faecium. Notably, a case of linezolid resistance due to a mutation was documented. Conclusions: The study illustrates the concerning prevalence of multidrug-resistant Enterococci in Latvian hospitals, showcasing the rather widespread occurrence of vancomycin-resistant strains. This highlights the urgency of implementing efficient infection control mechanisms and the need for continuous VRE surveillance in Latvia to define the scope and pattern of the problem, influencing clinical decision making and planning further preventative measures.",,"Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR, (M)LST",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

644,2024,"Metagenomic analysis of microbial consortia native to the Amazon, Highlands, and Galapagos regions of Ecuador with potential for wastewater remediation","Abstract Native microbial consortia have been proposed for biological wastewater treatment, but their diversity and function remain poorly understood. This study investigated three native microalgae‐bacteria consortia collected from the Amazon, Highlands, and Galapagos regions of Ecuador to assess their metagenomes and wastewater remediation potential. The consortia were evaluated for 12 days under light (LC) and continuous dark conditions (CDC) to measure their capacity for nutrient and organic matter removal from synthetic wastewater (SWW). Overall, all three consortia demonstrated higher nutrient removal efficiencies under LC than CDC, with the Amazon and Galapagos consortia outperforming the Highlands consortium in nutrient removal capabilities. Despite differences in α‐ and β‐diversity, microbial species diversity within and between consortia did not directly correlate with their nutrient removal capabilities. However, all three consortia were enriched with core taxonomic groups associated with wastewater remediation activities. Our analyses further revealed higher abundances for nutrient removing microorganisms in the Amazon and Galapagos consortia compared with the Highland consortium. Finally, this study also uncovered the contribution of novel microbial groups that enhance wastewater bioremediation processes. These groups have not previously been reported as part of the core microbial groups commonly found in wastewater communities, thereby highlighting the potential of investigating microbial consortia isolated from ecosystems of megadiverse countries like Ecuador.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
645,2024,Enterobacteriaceae as a Key Indicator of Huanglongbing Infection in Diaphorina citri,"Extensive microbial interactions occur within insect hosts. However, the interactions between the Huanglongbing (HLB) pathogen and endosymbiotic bacteria within the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama) in wild populations remain elusive. Thus, this study aimed to detect the infection rates of HLB in the ACP across five localities in China, with a widespread prevalence in Ruijin (RJ, 58%), Huidong (HD, 28%), and Lingui (LG, 15%) populations. Next, microbial communities of RJ and LG populations collected from citrus were analyzed via 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The results revealed a markedly higher microbial diversity in the RJ population compared to the LG population. Moreover, the PCoA analysis identified significant differences in microbial communities between the two populations. Considering that the inter-population differences of Bray–Curtis dissimilarity in the RJ population exceeded those between populations, separate analyses were performed. Our findings indicated an increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae in individuals infected with HLB in both populations. Random forest analysis also identified Enterobacteriaceae as a crucial indicator of HLB infection. Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis suggested a potential regulatory role of ASV4017 in Enterobacteriaceae for ACP, suggesting its possible attractant activity. This research contributes to expanding the understanding of microbial communities associated with HLB infection, holding significant implications for HLB prevention and treatment.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Interactome",Metabarcoding,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
646,2024,Trophic Position of the White Worm (Enchytraeus albidus) in the Context of Digestive Enzyme Genes Revealed by Transcriptomics Analysis,"To assess the impact of Enchytraeidae (potworms) on the functioning of the decomposer system, knowledge of the feeding preferences of enchytraeid species is required. Different food preferences can be explained by variations in enzymatic activities among different enchytraeid species, as there are no significant differences in the morphology or anatomy of their alimentary tracts. However, it is crucial to distinguish between the contribution of microbial enzymes and the animal’s digestive capacity. Here, we computationally analyzed the endogenous digestive enzyme genes in Enchytraeus albidus. The analysis was based on RNA-Seq of COI-monohaplotype culture (PL-A strain) specimens, utilizing transcriptome profiling to determine the trophic position of the species. We also corroborated the results obtained using transcriptomics data from genetically heterogeneous freeze-tolerant strains. Our results revealed that E. albidus expresses a wide range of glycosidases, including GH9 cellulases and a specific digestive SH3b-domain-containing i-type lysozyme, previously described in the earthworm Eisenia andrei. Therefore, E. albidus combines traits of both primary decomposers (primary saprophytophages) and secondary decomposers (sapro-microphytophages/microbivores) and can be defined as an intermediate decomposer. Based on assemblies of publicly available RNA-Seq reads, we found close homologs for these cellulases and i-type lysozymes in various clitellate taxa, including Crassiclitellata and Enchytraeidae.",Virus,Functional analysis,(Meta)transcriptomics,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
647,2024,Serial fermentation in milk generates functionally diverse community lineages with different degrees of structure stabilization,"ABSTRACT Microbial communities offer considerable potential for tackling environmental challenges by improving the functioning of ecosystems. Top-down community engineering is a promising strategy that could be used to obtain communities of desired function. However, the ecological factors that control the balance between community shaping and propagation are not well understood. Dairy backslopping, which consists of using part of the previous production to inoculate a new one, can be used as a model engineering approach to investigate community dynamics during serial propagations. In this study, 26 raw milk samples were serially propagated 6 times each, giving rise to 26 community lineages. Bacterial community structures were analyzed by metabarcoding, and acidification was recorded by pH monitoring. The results revealed that different types of community lineages could be obtained in terms of taxonomic composition and dynamics. Five lineages reached a repeatable community structure in a few propagation steps, with little variation between the final generations, giving rise to stable acidification kinetics. Moreover, these stabilized communities presented a high variability of structure and diverse acidification properties between community lineages. Besides, the other lineages were characterized by different levels of dynamics leading to parallel or divergent trajectories. The functional properties and dynamics of the communities were mainly related to the relative abundance and the taxonomic composition of lactic acid bacteria within the communities. These findings highlight that short-term schemes of serial fermentation can produce communities with a wide range of dynamics and that the balance between community shaping and propagation is intimately linked to community structure. IMPORTANCE Microbiome applications require approaches for shaping and propagating microbial communities. Shaping allows the selection of communities with desired taxonomic and functional properties, while propagation allows the production of the biomass required to inoculate the engineered communities in the target ecosystem. In top-down community engineering, where communities are obtained from a pool of mixed microorganisms by acting on environmental variables, a major challenge is to master the balance between shaping and propagation. However, the ecological factors that favor high dynamics of community structure and, conversely, those that favor stability during propagation are not well understood. In this work, short-term dairy backslopping was used to investigate the key role of the taxonomic composition and structure of bacterial communities on their dynamics. The results obtained open up interesting prospects for the biotechnological use of microbiomes, particularly in the field of dairy fermentation, to diversify approaches for injecting microbial biodiversity into cheesemaking processes.

648,2024,Discovery and characterisation of new phage targeting uropathogenic Escherichia coli,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is increasing at an escalating rate with few new therapeutic options in the pipeline. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most prevalent bacterial infections globally and are particularly prone to becoming recurrent and antibiotic resistant. The aim of this study was to discover and characterise new bacterial viruses (phage) against uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), which is the leading cause of UTIs. Six phages from the Autographiviridae family and Guernseyvirinae sub-family were isolated from wastewater and sequenced. The length of the isolated phage genomes was between 39,471 bp and 45,233 bp, with a GC content between 45.0% and 51.0%, and 57 to 84 predicted coding sequences (CDS) per genome. These phages were found to infect between 25 – 75% of the twelve UPEC strains tested. Using sequence comparison and predicted structural alignments, we show a similarity between the C-terminal domain of the tail fiber proteins of two phage that correlates with their host range. In vitro characterisation of phage cocktails against a single bacterial strain did not perform better than the best-performing phage, but did show synergistic improvement against a mixed UPEC strain population. Lastly, we measured the effectiveness of treatment with phage with different lytic kinetics in a sequential treatment and found it was improved over single phage treatment.","Bacteria, Virus, Pathogen","Isolate, AMR",(Meta)genomics,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

In this study, we analyzed a large collection of Enterobacterales other than Klebsiella spp. received in our reference laboratory between 2013 and 2022. A total of 32 clinical isolates displaying different pulsed‐field gel electrophoresis profiles, and represented by 11 species in the families Enterobacteriaceae (Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter portucalensis, Enterobacter hormaechei, and Escherichia coli), Morganellaceae (Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, and Raoultella ornithinolytica), and Yersiniaceae (Serratia marcescens) had their whole genomes sequenced and further analyzed. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion, except for polymyxin B, assessed by broth microdilution. The blaNDM‐1 allele was predominant (n = 29), but blaNDM‐5 was identified in an E. coli specimen with a novel ST, and the blaNDM‐7 allele was found in E. hormaechei ST45 and E. coli ST1049. Polymyxin was active against all but one Enterobacteriaceae isolate: an mcr‐1–producing E. coli presenting minimal inhibitory concentration (4 mg/L). Isolates producing extended‐spectrum β‐lactamases were common: cefotaximase from Munich (CTX‐M)‐15 (n = 10), CTX‐M‐2 (n = 4), and CTX‐M‐8 (n = 3) were detected, and the mcr‐1–producing E. coli was found to co‐produce both CTX‐M‐8 and CTX‐M‐55 β‐lactamases. The mcr‐9 gene was found in 5/8 E. hormaechei isolates, distributed in four different sequence types, all of them presenting susceptibility to polymyxin. This study showed that NDM‐producing Enterobacterales other than Klebsiella are already spread in Brazil, in diversified species, and cocarrying important resistance genes. Prompt detection and effective implementation of measures to prevent further spread are mandatory for mitigating the dissemination of NDM carbapenemase in hospital settings and preserving the already limited antimicrobial therapy options.",Bacteria,"Isolate, AMR",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease
651,2023,Escherichia coli Microcin B17 as a chassis for the development of novel antimicrobial peptides,"Antimicrobial resistance remains an urgent and growing global health problem. Peptides with antimicrobial activity are widespread in nature but are rarely harnessed for application, making them an underexplored and untapped resource. Many harbor post-translational modifications, which are essential for function and have evolved alongside specialized export and immunity machineries – leading to the current paradigm that natural sequences cannot be changed, and curtailing their development as antimicrobial agents. Nonetheless, we found sufficient ambiguity in literature to question if that remained true for E. coli MccB17. We demonstrate that its natural machinery for synthesis, export and immunity, can be co-opted as a platform for novel azole-modified antimicrobial peptide discovery. We show that the sequence space available for exploration is large and densely populated with functional sequences. One-Sentence Summary E. coli can be harnessed as an in vivo platform for the isolation of novel antimicrobial azole-modified peptides.",,"Functional analysis, AMR",,Health & Disease
652,2023,Viruses participate in the organomineralization of travertines,"Travertines, which precipitate from high temperature water saturated with calcium carbonate, are generally considered to be dominated by physico-chemical and microbial precipitates. Here, as an additional influence on organomineral formation, metagenomic data and microscopic analyses clearly demonstrate that highly diverse viral, bacterial and archaeal communities occur in the biofilms associated with several modern classic travertine sites in Europe and Asia, along with virus-like particles. Metagenomic analysis reveals that bacteriophages (bacterial viruses) containing icosahedral capsids and belonging to the Siphoviridae, Myoviridae and Podoviridae families are the most abundant of all viral strains, although the bacteriophage distribution does vary across the sampling sites. Icosahedral shapes of capsids are also the most frequently observed under the microscope, occurring as non-mineralized through to mineralized viruses and virus-like particles. Viruses are initially mineralized by Ca-Si amorphous precipitates with subordinate Mg and Al contents; these then alter to nanospheroids composed of Ca carbonate with minor silicate 80–300 nm in diameter. Understanding the roles of bacteriophages in modern carbonate-saturated settings and related organomineralization processes is critical for their broader inclusion in the geological record and ecosystem models.","Bacteria, Virus, Archaea, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,"(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
653,2023,The challenges of the genome-based identification of antifungal resistance in the clinical routine,"The increasing number of chronic and life-threatening infections caused by antimicrobial resistant fungal isolates is of critical concern. Low DNA sequencing cost may facilitate the identification of the genomic profile leading to resistance, the resistome, to rationally optimize the design of antifungal therapies. However, compared to bacteria, initiatives for resistome detection in eukaryotic pathogens are underdeveloped. Firstly, reported mutations in antifungal targets leading to reduced susceptibility must be extensively collected from the literature to generate comprehensive databases. This information should be complemented with specific laboratory screenings to detect the highest number possible of relevant genetic changes in primary targets and associations between resistance and other genomic markers. Strikingly, some drug resistant strains experience high-level genetic changes such as ploidy variation as much as duplications and reorganizations of specific chromosomes. Such variations involve allelic dominance, gene dosage increments and target expression regime effects that should be explicitly parameterized in antifungal resistome prediction algorithms. Clinical data indicate that predictors need to consider the precise pathogen species and drug levels of detail, instead of just genus and drug class. The concomitant needs for mutation accuracy and assembly quality assurance suggest hybrid sequencing approaches involving third-generation methods will be utilized. Moreover, fatal fast infections, like fungemia and meningitis, will further require both sequencing and analysis facilities are available in-house. Altogether, the complex nature of antifungal resistance demands extensive sequencing, data acquisition and processing, bioinformatic analysis pipelines, and standard protocols to be accomplished prior to genome-based protocols are applied in the clinical setting.","Bacteria, Eukaryote, Pathogen","Isolate, AMR, MAGs",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease
654,2023,Highly sensitive quantitative phase microscopy and deep learning aided with whole genome sequencing for rapid detection of infection and antimicrobial resistance,"Current state-of-the-art infection and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) diagnostics are based on culture-based methods with a detection time of 48–96 h. Therefore, it is essential to develop novel methods that can do real-time diagnoses. Here, we demonstrate that the complimentary use of label-free optical assay with whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can enable rapid diagnosis of infection and AMR. Our assay is based on microscopy methods exploiting label-free, highly sensitive quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) followed by deep convolutional neural networks-based classification. The workflow was benchmarked on 21 clinical isolates from four WHO priority pathogens that were antibiotic susceptibility tested, and their AMR profile was determined by WGS. The proposed optical assay was in good agreement with the WGS characterization. Accurate classification based on the gram staining (100% recall for gram-negative and 83.4% for gram-positive), species (98.6%), and resistant/susceptible type (96.4%), as well as at the individual strain level (100% sensitivity in predicting 19 out of the 21 strains, with an overall accuracy of 95.45%). The results from this initial proof-of-concept study demonstrate the potential of the QPM assay as a rapid and first-stage tool for species, strain-level classification, and the presence or absence of AMR, which WGS can follow up for confirmation. Overall, a combined workflow with QPM and WGS complemented with deep learning data analyses could, in the future, be transformative for detecting and identifying pathogens and characterization of the AMR profile and antibiotic susceptibility.",Pathogen,"Isolate, AMR",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease

656,2023,Galaxy ASIST: A web-based platform for mapping and assessment of global standards of antimicrobial susceptibility: A case study in Acinetobacter baumannii genomes,"Introduction Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is used to determine the susceptibility of an organism to antibiotics. The determination of susceptibility is based on MIC breakpoints and is provided by EUCAST and CLSI. Likewise, phenotypic classification criteria developed by CDC/ECDC are used for the classification of pathogens into susceptible, multidrug-resistant, extremely drug-resistant, or totally drug-resistant categories. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS)-based diagnosis is now supplementing existing gold-standard microbiology methods for rapid and more precise AST, and therefore, EUCAST recommended quality criteria to assess whole-genome sequence for reporting the same. In this study, these three global standards, MIC breakpoints, phenotypic classification, and genome quality, are applied to the largest publicly available data for Acinetobacter baumannii (AB), the most critical priority pathogen identified by WHO. Materials and Methods The drug sensitivity profile and genomes for isolates of AB were obtained from PATRIC and evaluated with respect to AST standards (CLSI and EUCAST). Whole genome quality assessment and antimicrobial resistance mapping is performed with QUAST and ABRicate, respectively. Four in-house methods are developed for mapping standards and are integrated into a Galaxy workflow based system, Galaxy-ASIST. Analysis of the extent of agreement between CLSI 2022 and EUCAST 2022 for antibiotics was carried out using Cohen’s kappa statistics. Results and Discussion An automated pipeline, Galaxy-ASIST, is designed and developed for the characterization of clinical isolates based on these standards. Evaluation of over 6,500 AB strains using Galaxy-ASIST indicated that only 10% of the publicly available datasets have metadata to implement these standards. Furthermore, given that CLSI and EUCAST have different MIC breakpoints, discrepancies are observed in the classification of resistant and susceptible isolates following these standards. It is, therefore, imperative that platforms are developed that allow the evaluation of ever increasing phenotypic and genome sequence datasets for AST. Galaxy-ASIST offers a centralized repository and a structured metadata architecture to provide a single globally acceptable framework for AST profiling of clinical isolates based on global standards. The platform also offers subsequent fine mapping of antimicrobial-resistant determinants.

657,2022,Effects of Hst3p inhibition in Candida albicans: a genome-wide H3K56 acetylation analysis,"Candida spp. represent the third most frequent worldwide cause of infection in Intensive Care Units with a mortality rate of almost 40%. The classes of antifungals currently available include azoles, polyenes, echinocandins, pyrimidine derivatives, and allylamines. However, the therapeutical options for the treatment of candidiasis are drastically reduced by the increasing antifungal resistance. The growing need for a more targeted antifungal therapy is limited by the concern of finding molecules that specifically recognize the microbial cell without damaging the host. Epigenetic writers and erasers have emerged as promising targets in different contexts, including the treatment of fungal infections. In C. albicans, Hst3p, a sirtuin that deacetylates H3K56ac, represents an attractive antifungal target as it is essential for the fungus viability and virulence. Although the relevance of such epigenetic regulator is documented for the development of new antifungal therapies, the molecular mechanism behind Hst3p-mediated epigenetic regulation remains unrevealed. Here, we provide the first genome-wide profiling of H3K56ac in C. albicans resulting in H3K56ac enriched regions associated with Candida sp. pathogenicity. Upon Hst3p inhibition, 447 regions gain H3K56ac. Importantly, these genomic areas contain genes encoding for adhesin proteins, degradative enzymes, and white-opaque switching. Moreover, our RNA-seq analysis revealed 1330 upregulated and 1081 downregulated transcripts upon Hst3p inhibition, and among them, we identified 87 genes whose transcriptional increase well correlates with the enrichment of H3K56 acetylation on their promoters, including some well-known regulators of phenotypic switching and virulence. Based on our evidence, Hst3p is an appealing target for the development of new potential antifungal drugs.",Pathogen,AMR,(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease

In this study, we characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing and by molecular typing a large collection of NDM-producing Klebsiella isolates from different hospitals in Brazil, mainly from the state of Sao Paulo, over the last decade. Methods: Bacterial isolates positive for blaNDM-genes were identified by MALDI-TOF MS and submitted to antimicrobial susceptibility testing by disk diffusion or broth microdilution (for polymyxin B). All isolates were submitted to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and isolates belonging to different clusters were submitted to whole genome sequencing by Illumina technology and downstream analysis. Mating out assays were performed by conjugation, plasmid sizes were determined by S1-PFGE, and plasmid content was investigated by hybrid assembly after MinIon long reads sequencing. Results: A total of 135 NDM-producing Klebsiella were identified, distributed into 107 different pulsotypes; polymyxin B was the only antimicrobial with high activity against 88.9% of the isolates. Fifty-four isolates presenting diversified pulsotypes were distributed in the species K. pneumoniae (70%), K. quasipneumoniae (20%), K. variicola (6%), K. michiganensis (a K. oxytoca Complex species, 2%), and K. aerogenes (2%); blaNDM-1 was the most frequent allele (43/54, 80%). There was a predominance of Clonal Group 258 (ST11 and ST340) encompassing 35% of K. pneumoniae isolates, but another thirty-one different sequence types (ST) were identified, including three described in this study (ST6244 and ST6245 for K. pneumoniae, and ST418 for K. michiganensis).

659,2025,Proteogenomic analysis demonstrates increased blaOXA-48 copy numbers and OmpK36 loss as contributors to carbapenem resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae,"ABSTRACT Antimicrobial resistance arises from complex genetic and regulatory changes, including single mutations, gene acquisitions, or cumulative effects. Advancements in genomics and proteomics facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms behind antimicrobial resistance. In this study, 74 clinically obtained Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates with increased meropenem and/or imipenem MICs were characterized by broth microdilution and PCR to check for the presence of carbapenemase genes. Subsequently, a representative subset of 15 isolates was selected for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) by Illumina and Nanopore sequencing, and proteomic analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to investigate the mechanisms underlying the differences in carbapenem susceptibility of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. Identical techniques were applied to characterize four mutants obtained after sequential meropenem exposure. We demonstrated that in clinically obtained isolates, increased copy numbers of blaOXA-48-containing plasmids, combined with OmpK36 loss, contributed to high carbapenem MICs without the involvement of OmpK35 or other porins or efflux systems. In the meropenem-exposed mutants, increased copy numbers of blaCTX-M-15 or blaOXA-48-containing plasmids, combined with OmpK36 loss, were demonstrated. The OmpK36 loss resulted from the insertion of IS1 transposable elements or partial deletion of the ompK36 gene. Additionally, we identified two mutations, C59A and C58A, in the DNA coding the copA antisense RNA of IncFII plasmids and multiple mutations of an IncR plasmid, associated with increased plasmid copy numbers. This study demonstrates that by combining WGS and LC-MS/MS, the effect of genomic changes on protein expression related to antibiotic resistance and the mechanisms behind antibiotic resistance can be elucidated.",,"Isolate, AMR","(Meta)genomics, (Meta)proteomics",Health & Disease
660,2025,De novo peptide databases enable protein-based stable isotope probing of microbial communities with up to species-level resolution,"Background Protein-based stable isotope probing (Protein-SIP) is a powerful approach that can directly link individual taxa to activity and substrate assimilation, elucidating metabolic pathways and trophic relationships within microbial communities. In Protein-SIP, peptides and corresponding taxa are identified by database matching, making database quality crucial for accurate analyses. For samples with unknown community composition, Protein-SIP typically employs either unrestricted reference databases or metagenome-derived databases. While (meta)genome-derived databases represent the gold standard, they may be incomplete and are typically resource-intensive to generate. In contrast, unrestricted reference databases can inflate the search space and require complex post-processing. Results Here, we explore the feasibility of using de novo peptide sequencing to construct peptide databases directly from mass spectrometry raw data. We then use the mass spectrometric data from labeled cultures to quantify isotope incorporation into specific peptides. We benchmark our approach against the canonical approach in which a sample-matching (meta)genome-derived protein sequence database is used on three different datasets: 1) a proteome analysis from a defined microbial community containing 13C-labeled E. coli cells, 2) time-course data of an anammox-dominated continuous reactor after feeding with 13C-labeled bicarbonate, and 3) a model of the human distal gut simulating a high-protein and high-fiber diet cultivated in either 2H2O or H218O. Our results show that de novo peptide databases are applicable to different isotopes, detecting similar amounts of labeled peptides compared to sample-matching (meta)genome-derived databases, and also identify labeled peptides missed by this canonical approach. Furthermore, we show that peptide-centric Protein-SIP allows up to species-specific resolution and enables the assessment of activity related to individual biological processes. Finally, we provide access to our modular Python pipeline to assist the construction of de novo peptide databases and subsequent peptide-centric Protein-SIP data analysis (https://git.ufz.de/meb/denovo-sip). Conclusions De novo peptide databases enable Protein-SIP of microbial communities without prior knowledge of the composition and can be used complementarily to (meta)genome-derived databases or as a standalone alternative in exploratory or resource-limited settings.",Microbiome,Community (taxonomy) profiling,"(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics, (Meta)proteomics",
661,2025,"Shotgun metagenomic composition, microbial interactions and functional insights into the uterine microbiome of postpartum dairy cows with clinical and subclinical endometritis","Clinical endometritis (CE) is associated with bacterial pathogens while the same has not been proved about subclinical endometritis (SCE). We aimed to use shotgun metagenomic sequencing to investigate the associations between potentially unidentified pathogens and SCE. Uterine cytobrush samples from multiparous Holstein cows (n = 23) were taken at 21 days in milk (DIM) and sequenced via the Illumina shotgun platform. At 36 DIM, the cows were diagnosed as CE (n = 7), SCE (n = 7), or healthy (n = 9). We did not find differences in the alpha and beta diversity of bacteria and eukaryotes among the health groups. Relative abundance of typical pathogens i.e. Fusobacterium, Peptoniphilus, Peptostreptococcus, and Trueperella was greater in CE than healthy controls. We did not find evidence of eukaryotic or viral association in infection, yet, distinct patterns of bacterial co-occurrence were observed among pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria. In CE cows, Wnt/catenin pathway had lower abundance than SCE or healthy cows. Our findings support that CE is characterized by domination of pathogenic bacteria that intercorrelate, whereas SCE is not associated with bacterial colonization.

663,2025,Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance in the Asian Seabass (Lates calcarifer) Supply Chain Using Nanopore Sequencing,"Intensive fish farming worldwide has increased reliance on antibiotics to control bacterial pathogens, raising concerns about antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in aquaculture. These resistant bacteria can persist and pass through the food supply chain, from farms to consumers. Despite this risk, antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in aquaculture environments and fish products have not been elucidated. This study aimed to detect ARGs found in the Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer), an economically important fish in Thailand, collected from farms, fish container vehicles, and markets, using Nanopore metagenomic sequencing. We detected multiple ARGs in all sample types. Water samples harbored the rpsL gene conferring streptomycin resistance. Container samples exhibited the highest diversity of ARGs, including multiple beta-lactamases and the rsmA gene, conferring resistance to fluoroquinolones, diaminopyrimidines, and phenicol antibiotics. Fish samples generally lacked ARGs, except for one sample harboring rsmA. Non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed distinct microbial communities in water, compared with those found in container and fish samples, indicating potential cross-contamination during handling or storage. Our findings emphasize that containers could be critical control points for minimizing AMR spread. Overall, this study highlights the interconnection between environmental, fish, and human health, highlighting the importance of integrated AMR surveillance and management in aquaculture systems.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
664,2025,Novel Anti-MRSA Peptide from Mangrove-Derived Virgibacillus chiguensis FN33 Supported by Genomics and Molecular Dynamics,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health threat, with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) being one of the major resistant pathogens. This study reports the isolation of a novel mangrove-derived bacterium, Virgibacillus chiguensis FN33, as identified through genome analysis and the discovery of a new anionic antimicrobial peptide (AMP) exhibiting anti-MRSA activity. The AMP was composed of 23 amino acids, which were elucidated as NH3-Glu-Gly-Gly-Cys-Gly-Val-Asp-Thr-Trp-Gly-Cys-Leu-Thr-Pro-Cys-His-Cys-Asp-Leu-Phe-Cys-Thr-Thr-COOH. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) for MRSA were 8 µg/mL and 16 µg/mL, respectively. FN33 AMP induced cell membrane permeabilization, suggesting a membrane-disrupting mechanism. The AMP remained stable at 30–40 °C but lost activity at higher temperatures and following exposure to proteases, surfactants, and extreme pH. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations showed that the AMP adopts a β-sheet structure upon membrane interaction. These findings suggest that Virgibacillus chiguensis FN33 is a promising source of novel antibacterial agents against MRSA, supporting alternative strategies for drug-resistant infections.","Bacteria, Pathogen","Interactome, AMR",(Meta)genomics,Health & Disease
665,2025,"Linking peri-implantitis to microbiome changes in affected implants, healthy implants, and saliva: a cross-sectional pilot study","Introduction The rising use of dental implants is accompanied by an expected increase in peri-implant diseases, particularly peri-implantitis (PI), which poses a significant threat to implant success and necessitates a thorough understanding of its pathogenesis for effective management. Methods To gain deeper insights into the role and impact of the peri-implant microbiome in the pathogenesis and progression of PI, we analyzed 100 samples of saliva and subgingival biofilm from 40 participants with healthy implants (HI group) or with co-occurrence of diagnosed PI-affected implants and healthy implants (PI group) using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We identified the most discriminative species distinguishing healthy from diseased study groups through log ratios and differential ranking analyses. Results and discussion Mogibacterium timidum, Schaalia cardiffensis, Parvimonas micra, Filifactor alocis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Olsenella uli were associated with the subgingival peri-implant biofilm. In contrast, Neisseria sp oral taxon 014, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Actinomyces naeslundii, Rothia mucilaginosa and Rothia aeria were more prevalent in the healthy peri-implant biofilm. Functional pathways such as arginine and polyamine biosynthesis, including putrescine and citrulline biosynthesis, showed stronger correlations with PI-affected implants. In contrast, peri-implant health was characterized by the predominance of pathways involved in purine and pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotide de novo biosynthesis, glucose and glucose-1-phosphate degradation, and tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. Our findings reveal that healthy implants in PI-free oral cavities differ significantly in microbial composition and functional pathways compared to healthy implants co-occurring with PI-affected implants, which more closely resemble PI-associated profiles. This pattern extended to salivary samples, where microbial and functional biomarkers follow similar trends.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Functional analysis, Gene identification / Biomarker","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
666,2025,Exploring the microbial communities in coastal cenote and their hidden biotechnological potential,"Abstract Bacterial secondary metabolites are crucial bioactive compounds with significant therapeutic potential, playing key roles in ecological processes and the discovery of novel antimicrobial agents and natural products. Cenotes, as extreme environments, harbour untapped microbial diversity and hold an interesting potential as sources of novel secondary metabolites. While research has focused on the fauna and flora of cenotes, the study of their microbial communities and their biosynthetic capabilities remains limited. Advances in metagenomics and genome sequencing have greatly improved the capacity to explore these communities and their metabolites. In this study, we analysed the microbial diversity and biotechnological potential of micro-organisms inhabiting sediments from a coastal cenote. Metagenomic analyses revealed a rich diversity of bacterial and archaeal communities, containing several novel biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) linked to secondary metabolite production. Notably, polyketide synthase BGCs, including those encoding ladderanes and aryl-polyenes, were identified. Bioinformatics analyses of these pathways suggest the presence of compounds with potential industrial and pharmaceutical applications. These findings highlight the biotechnological value of cenotes as reservoirs of secondary metabolites. The study and conservation of these ecosystems are essential to facilitate the discovery of new bioactive compounds that could benefit various industries.","Bacteria, Archaea, Microbiome","Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR","(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics, Metabolomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
667,2025,Revealing microbial consortia that interfere with grapevine downy mildew through microbiome epidemiology,"Background Plant and soil microbiomes can interfere with pathogen life cycles, but their influence on disease epidemiology remains understudied. Here, we analyzed the relationships between plant and soil microbiomes and long-term epidemiological records of grapevine downy mildew, a major disease caused by the oomycete Plasmopara viticola. Results We found that certain microbial taxa were consistently more abundant in plots with lower disease incidence and severity and that the microbial community composition could predict disease incidence and severity. Microbial diversity was not strongly linked to epidemiological records, suggesting that disease incidence and severity is more related to the abundance of specific microbial taxa. These key taxa were identified in the topsoil, where the pathogen’s oospores overwinter, and in the phyllosphere, where zoospores infect leaves. By contrast, the leaf endosphere, where the pathogen’s mycelium develops, contained few taxa of interest. Surprisingly, the soil microbiota was a better predictor of disease incidence and severity than the leaf microbiota, suggesting that the soil microbiome could be a key indicator of the dynamics of this primarily aerial disease. Conclusion Our study integrates long-term epidemiological data with microbiome profiles of healthy plants to reveal fungi and bacteria relevant for the biocontrol of grapevine downy mildew. The resulting database provides a valuable resource for designing microbial consortia with potential biocontrol activity. The framework can be applied to other crop systems to guide the development of biocontrol strategies and reduce pesticide use in agriculture.

668,2025,Characterization and genomic analysis of Sharanji: a jumbo bacteriophage of Escherichia coli,"Background Bacteriophages are the most genetically diverse biological entities in nature. Our current understanding of phage biology primarily stems from studies on a limited number of model bacteriophages. Jumbo phages, characterized by their exceptionally large genomes, are less frequently isolated and studied. Some jumbo phages exhibit remarkable genetic diversity, unique infection mechanisms, and therapeutic potential. Methods In this study, we describe the isolation of Sharanji, a novel Escherichia coli jumbo phage, isolated from chicken feces. The phage genome was sequenced and analyzed extensively through gene annotation and phylogenetic analysis. The jumbo phage was phenotypically characterized through electron microscopy, host range analysis, and survival at different pH and temperatures, and one-step growth curve assay. Finally, Sharanji mediated infection of E. coli is studied through fluorescence microscopy, to analyze its mechanism of infection compared to well-studied nucleus-forming jumbo phages. Results Whole genome sequencing reveals that Sharanji has a genome size of 350,079 bp and is a phage encompassing 593 ORFs. Genomic analysis indicates that the phage belongs to the Asteriusvirus genus and is related to E. coli jumbo phages PBECO4 and 121Q. Phenotypic analysis of isolated phage Sharanji, indicates that the phage size is 245.3 nm, and it is a narrow-spectrum phage infecting E. coli K12 strains, but not other bacteria including avian pathogenic E. coli. Infection analysis using microscopy shows that Sharanji infection causes cell filamentation. Furthermore, intracellular phage nucleus-like structures were not observed in Sharanji-infected cells, in contrast to infection by ΦKZ-like jumbo phages. Conclusions Our study reports the isolation and characterization of Sharanji, one of the large E. coli jumbo phages. Both genotypic and phenotypic analyses suggest that Sharanji serves as a unique model system for studying phage-bacteria interactions, particularly within the context of non-nucleus-forming jumbo phages. Further exploration of jumbo phages holds promise for uncovering new paradigms in the study of microbial viruses.

670,2025,Pseudomonas Species Isolated From Lotus Nodules Are Genetically Diverse and Promote Plant Growth,"ABSTRACT Nodules harbour microbial communities composed of rhizobia and other lower‐abundance bacteria. These non‐rhizobial bacteria can promote plant growth. However, their genomic diversity and how this relates to their plant growth‐promoting traits remain poorly investigated. Here, we isolated 14 Pseudomonas strains from the nodules of Lotus plants, sequenced their genomes, analysed their genomic and phylogenetic diversity, and assessed their ability to promote plant growth. We identified five distinct species, including a novel species named Pseudomonas monachiensis sp. nov., with strain PLb12AT, as the type strain. Genome analysis of these nodule‐isolated Pseudomonas revealed an abundance of genes associated to plant growth‐promoting traits, especially auxin‐related genes, compared to closely related type strains. In accordance, most nodule‐isolated Pseudomonas strains enhanced shoot growth of Lotus burttii, while only some promoted root growth or early onset of root hair proliferation. However, none of the strains significantly affected the ability to form nodules. Overall, our findings highlight the genotypic diversity and the plant growth‐promoting potential of nodule‐isolated Pseudomonas and underscore their possible applications in mixed inocula with rhizobia.","Bacteria, Microbiome","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling",(Meta)genomics,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
671,2025,Comprehensive survey of kombucha microbial communities of diverse origins and fermentation practices,"Abstract Kombucha is a unique, naturally fermented sweetened tea produced for thousands of years, relying on a symbiotic microbiota in a floating biofilm, used for successive fermentations. The microbial communities consist of yeast and bacteria species, distributed across two phases: the liquid and the biofilm fractions. In the fermentation of kombucha, various starters of different shapes and origins are used, and there are multiple brewing practices. By metabarcoding, we explored here the consortia and their evolution from a collection of 23 starters coming from various origins summarizing the diversity of kombucha fermentation processes. A core microbiota of yeast and bacteria has been identified in these diverse kombucha symbiotic consortia, revealing consistent core taxa across symbiotic consortium of bacteria and yeasts from different starters. The common core consists of five taxa: two yeast species from the Brettanomyces genus (B. bruxellensis and B. anomalus) and bacterial taxa Komagataeibacter, Lactobacillus, and Acetobacteraceae, including the Acetobacter genus. The distribution of yeast and bacteria core taxa differs between the liquid and biofilm fractions, as well as between the “mother” and “daughter” biofilms used in successive fermentations. In terms of microbial composition, the diversity is relatively low, with only a few accessory taxa identified. Overall, our study provides a deeper understanding of the core and accessory taxa involved in kombucha fermentation.","Bacteria, Microbiome",Community (taxonomy) profiling,Metabarcoding,Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity
672,2025,Predicting coarse-grained representations of biogeochemical cycles from metabarcoding data,"Motivation Taxonomic analysis of environmental microbial communities is now routinely performed thanks to advances in DNA sequencing. Determining the role of these communities in global biogeochemical cycles requires the identification of their metabolic functions, such as hydrogen oxidation, sulfur reduction, and carbon fixation. These functions can be directly inferred from metagenomics data, but in many environmental applications metabarcoding is still the method of choice. The reconstruction of metabolic functions from metabarcoding data and their integration into coarse-grained representations of geobiochemical cycles remains a difficult bioinformatics problem today. Results We developed a pipeline, called Tabigecy, which exploits taxonomic affiliations to predict metabolic functions constituting biogeochemical cycles. In a first step, Tabigecy uses the tool EsMeCaTa to predict consensus proteomes from input affiliations. To optimise this process, we generated a precomputed database containing information about 2,404 taxa from UniProt. The consensus proteomes are searched using bigecyhmm, a newly developed Python package relying on Hidden Markov Models to identify key enzymes involved in metabolic function of biogeochemical cycles. The metabolic functions are then projected on coarse-grained representation of the cycles. We applied Tabigecy to two salt cavern datasets and validated its predictions with microbial activity and hydrochemistry measurements performed on the samples. The results highlight the utility of the approach to investigate the impact of microbial communities on geobiochemical processes.",Microbiome,"Community (taxonomy) profiling, Functional analysis","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics, (Meta)proteomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

675,2024,Lactobacilli-host interactions inhibit Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli-induced cell death and invasion in a cellular model of infection,"
 Probiotic lactobacilli exert antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity through a plethora of mechanisms, including the production of inhibitory compounds and competition for nutrients and adhesion sites on the host mucosa. Their ability to interfere with pathogen-host interactions may mitigate the harmful effects of infection. Lactiplantibacillus pentosus L33 (L33) and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum L125 (L125) are two potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains, previously shown to reduce pathogen viability and biofilm formation in vitro. The present study aims to investigate their ability to limit cell death induced by Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29. To this end, we examined the protective effects of the two strains using in silico, in vitro and omic approaches, with Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) serving as a reference strain, due to its well-documented antimicrobial properties. Based on the findings of our study, direct contact of HT-29 cells with L125 for 4 h prior to the addition of S. aureus or E. coli prevented pathogen-induced cell death at rates comparable to LGG. In contrast, L33 failed to exert a protective effect. Moreover, L125 significantly reduced adherence of S. aureus to HT-29 cells, and the internalization capacity of both pathogens (>1.5 Log CFU/mL). Dual RNA-seq and protein microarrays were used to determine expression changes in L125 and host cells during co-incubation. L125 expressed high levels of adhesins and moonlighting proteins, homologous to those encoded by the pathogens. Pathways involved in pathogen adhesion and internalization, endocytosis, cell–cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion, were downregulated in HT-29 cells. Finally, L125 reduced the secretion of various pro-inflammatory mediators. Our findings highlight the strain-specific protective effects of LAB against pathogen-induced cell death achieved through competitive exclusion and priming of host cell responses. Future studies will focus on elucidating the specific surface components of L125 involved in these events, paving the way for targeted interventions at the host-pathogen interface.

676,2024,Multi‐omics approach in gut and environmental microbiota research under the One Health concept,"Abstract The One Health concept, although formulated two decades ago, remains challenging to implement. It necessitates the integration of numerous scientific disciplines, diverse techniques and various professional expertise. Furthermore, it often requires the collaboration of different institutions, encompassing both scientific and administrative entities. This concept posits that human health is intrinsically linked to and dependent on the well‐being of animals, plants and the broader environment, while the environment not only sustains life but can also serve as a source of xenobiotics that affect the health‐disease balance. In this context, all components of the potential exposome, encompassing the entirety of factors of various natures that influence health throughout life, must be considered comprehensively. Achieving this holistic understanding typically demands the application of multiple research techniques, known as the multi‐omics approach and the adoption of an integrated method for data analysis. This project endeavoured to utilise such an integrated approach, examining data from diverse origins: human (children stool for gut microbiota analysis) and environmental (groundwater for hyporheic zone microbial analysis), as well as implementing comprehensive informatic tools for data processing. Analysis of stool samples revealed significant differences in gut microbiota composition across various taxonomic levels between normal weight, overweight and obese children. Additionally, a potential link between certain xenobiotics and gut microbiota composition, body weight and overall health status was identified. Analysis of groundwater samples revealed significant differences in hyporheic zone microbial composition at various taxonomic levels based on the sampling location and depth.

678,2024,The effects of livestock grazing on physicochemical properties and bacterial communities of perlite-rich soil,"Livestock grazing has been proposed as a cost-effective way to reclaim post-mining lands. It can enhance soil fertility and biodiversity, but its impacts on soil quality and microbial communities vary across soil types. Moreover, waste from grazing raises concerns about pathogens that could pose risks to animal and human health. This study investigated the effects of grazing on post-mining perlite-rich soil in central Thailand. A comparative analysis of soil physicochemical properties and bacterial diversity was conducted between grazed and ungrazed sites. Bacterial diversity was assessed using 16S amplicon sequencing. The perlite-rich soil was found to be sandy, acidic, and to have low nutritional content. Grazing significantly improved the soil texture and nutrient content, suggesting its potential as a cost-effective reclamation strategy. The 16S metagenomic sequencing analysis revealed that microbial communities were impacted by livestock grazing. Specifically, shifts in the dominant bacterial phyla were identified, with increases in Firmicutes and Chloroflexi and a decrease in Actinobacteria. Concerns about increased levels of pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae due to grazing were not substantiated in perlite-rich soil. These bacteria were consistently found at low levels in all soil samples, regardless of livestock grazing. This study also identified a diverse population of Streptomycetaceae, including previously uncharacterized strains/species. This finding could be valuable given that this bacterial family is known for producing antibiotics and other secondary metabolites. However, grazing adversely impacted the abundance and diversity of Streptomycetaceae in this specific soil type. In line with previous research, this study demonstrated that the response of soil microbial communities to grazing varies significantly depending on the soil type, with unique responses appearing to be associated with perlite-rich soil. This emphasizes the importance of soil-specific research in understanding how grazing affects microbial communities. Future research should focus on optimizing grazing practices for perlite-rich soil and characterizing the Streptomycetaceae community for potential antibiotic and secondary metabolite discovery. The obtained findings should ultimately contribute to sustainable post-mining reclamation through livestock grazing and the preservation of valuable microbial resources.","Bacteria, Microbiome, Pathogen","Community (taxonomy) profiling, Comparative analysis","Metabarcoding, (Meta)genomics, Metagenomics, Metabolomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"

Since mutations in these genes can threaten organism viability, identifying them is challenging. Conditionally essential genes are required only under specific conditions and are important for functions such as virulence, immunity, stress survival, and antibiotic resistance. Transposon-directed sequencing (Tn-Seq) has emerged as a powerful method for identifying both essential and conditionally essential genes. In this review, we explored Tn-Seq workflows, focusing on eubacterial species and some yeast species. A comparison of 14 eubacteria species revealed 133 conserved essential genes, including those involved in cell division (e.g., ftsA, ftsZ), DNA replication (e.g., dnaA, dnaE), ribosomal function, cell wall synthesis (e.g., murB, murC), and amino acid synthesis (e.g., alaS, argS). Many other essential genes lack clear orthologues across different microorganisms, making them specific to each organism studied. Conditionally essential genes were identified in 18 bacterial species grown under various conditions, but their conservation was low, reflecting dependence on specific environments and microorganisms. Advances in Tn-Seq are expected to reveal more essential genes in the near future, deepening our understanding of microbial biology and enhancing our ability to manipulate microbial growth, as well as both the primary and secondary metabolism.",Bacteria,"Functional analysis, AMR",,"Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
681,2024,iNAP 2.0: Harnessing metabolic complementarity in microbial network analysis,"Abstract With the widespread adoption of metagenomic sequencing, new perspectives have emerged for studying microbial ecological networks, yielding metabolic evidence of interspecies interactions that traditional co‐occurrence networks cannot infer. This protocol introduces the integrated Network Analysis Pipeline 2.0 (iNAP 2.0), which features an innovative metabolic complementarity network for microbial studies from metagenomics sequencing data. iNAP 2.0 sets up a four‐module process for metabolic interaction analysis, namely: (I) Prepare genome‐scale metabolic models; (II) Infer pairwise interactions of genome‐scale metabolic models; (III) Construct metabolic interaction networks; and (IV) Analyze metabolic interaction networks. Starting from metagenome‐assembled or complete genomes, iNAP 2.0 offers a variety of methods to quantify the potential and trends of metabolic complementarity between models, including the PhyloMint pipeline based on phylogenetic distance‐adjusted metabolic complementarity, the SMETANA (species metabolic interaction analysis) approach based on cross‐feeding substrate exchange prediction, and metabolic distance calculation based on parsimonious flux balance analysis (pFBA). Notably, iNAP 2.0 integrates the random matrix theory (RMT) approach to find the suitable threshold for metabolic interaction network construction. Finally, the metabolic interaction networks can proceed to analysis using topological feature analysis such as hub node determination. In addition, a key feature of iNAP 2.0 is the identification of potentially transferable metabolites between species, presented as intermediate nodes that connect microbial nodes in the metabolic complementarity network. To illustrate these new features, we use a set of metagenome‐assembled genomes as an example to comprehensively document the usage of the tools. iNAP 2.0 is available at https://inap.denglab.org.cn for all users to register and use for free.",,Interactome,"(Meta)genomics, Metagenomics, Metabolomics",Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity

The stability study indicated that this AMP was tolerant of various conditions, including proteolytic enzymes, pH (1.2–14), surfactants, and temperatures up to 40 °C for 12 h. The AMP demonstrated 4 µg/mL of MIC and 4–8 µg/mL of MBC against both pathogens. Time-kill kinetics showed that the AMP acted in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. A cell permeability assay and scanning electron microscopy revealed that the AMP exerted the mode of action by disrupting bacterial membranes. Additionally, nineteen biosynthetic gene clusters of secondary metabolites were identified in the genome. NNS5-6 was susceptible to various commonly used antibiotics supporting the primary safety requirement. The findings of this research could pave the way for new therapeutic approaches in combating antibiotic-resistant pathogens.","Bacteria, Pathogen","Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR","(Meta)genomics, Metabolomics",Health & Disease
683,2024,A Novel Bacitracin-like Peptide from Mangrove-Isolated Bacillus paralicheniformis NNS4-3 against MRSA and Its Genomic Insights,"The global rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) presents a critical challenge necessitating the discovery of novel antimicrobial agents. Mangrove microbes are valuable sources of new antimicrobial compounds. This study reports the discovery of a potent antimicrobial peptide (AMP) from Bacillus paralicheniformis NNS4-3, isolated from mangrove sediment, exhibiting significant activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The AMP demonstrated a minimum inhibitory concentration ranging from 1 to 16 µg/mL in the tested bacteria and exhibited bactericidal effects at higher concentrations. Structural analysis revealed a bacitracin-like configuration and the peptide acted by disrupting bacterial membranes in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The AMP maintained stability under heat, proteolytic enzymes, surfactants, and varying pH treatments. The ten biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) of secondary metabolites were found in the genome. Detailed sequence comparison of the predicted bacitracin BGC indicated distinct DNA sequences compared to previously reported strains. Although the antibiotic resistance genes were found, this strain was susceptible to antibiotics. Our findings demonstrated the potential of Bacillus paralicheniformis NNS4-3 and its AMP as a promising agent in combating AMR. The genetic information could be pivotal for future applications in the healthcare industry, emphasizing the need for continued exploration of marine microbial diversity in drug discovery.",Bacteria,"Isolate, Community (taxonomy) profiling, AMR","(Meta)genomics, Metabolomics","Ecosystem Dynamics & Biodiversity, Health & Disease"
684,2024,Engineering a wolf spider A-family toxin towards increased antimicrobial activity but low toxicity,"Peptides with insecticidal, antimicrobial and/or cytolytic activities, also known as spider venom antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), can be found in the venoms of RTA-clade spiders. They show translational potential as therapeutic leads. A set of 52 AMPs has been described in the Chinese wolf spider (Lycosa shansia), and many have been shown to exhibit antibacterial effects. Here we explored the potential to enhance their antimicrobial activity using bioengineering. We generated a panel of artificial derivatives of an A-family peptide and screened their activity against selected microbial pathogens, vertebrate cells and insects. In several cases, we increased the antimicrobial activity of the derivatives while retaining the low cytotoxicity of the parental molecule. Furthermore, we injected the peptides into adult Drosophila suzukii and found no evidence of insecticidal effects, confirming the low levels of toxicity. Our data therefore suggest that spider venom linear peptides can be modified into more potent antimicrobial agents that could help to battle infectious diseases in the future.","Bacteria, Pathogen",AMR,,Health & Disease
